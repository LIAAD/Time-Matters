    "- <b>InvertedIndex</b>: An inverted index of the document, most notably of its relevant keywords and temporal expressions. As other inverted indexes it follows the following dictionary structure: `{'term' : [SF, TotFreq, {SentenceID : [Freq, [Offsets]]}]`, where `SF` is the `Sentence Frequency`, `TotFreq` is the `total frequency` of the term, `SentenceID` is the `ID of the sentence` (knowing that IDs start on 0), `Freq` is the frequency of the term is that sentence and `[Offsets]` is a list of offsets, that is, a list of the position(s) where the term appears in the text. For instance, a term with the following structure `'2010': [2, 3, {1: [1, [6]], 5: [2, [90, 100]]}]` means that it has 3 occurrences in 2 different sentences. In the sentence with ID 1, it occurs 1 time in position 6. In sentence with ID 5, it occurs 2 times in position 90 and 100. Please note that positions are numbered sequentially from the firt to the last token of the text."

In this configuration, multiple occurrences of a temporal expression in different documents, will return multiple (eventually different) scores (e.g., 0.92 for the occurrence of 2019 in sentence 1 of document 1; and 0.77 for the occurrence of 2019 in sentence 2 of document 1). Once again, we apply the `year` granularity to avoid getting too many fine-grained temporal expressions. Yet, you are more than welcome to alternatively run the following code: `results = Time_Matters_MultipleDocs(ListOfDocs, score_type='ByDoc')`."

    "Getting temporal scores by document & sentence is possible through the following code. This configuration is set to consider \"py_heideltime\" as the default temporal tagger (more about this [here](https://github.com/LIAAD/wiki/How-to-use-Time-Matters-MultipleDocs#Temporal-Expressions)), \"ByDoc&Sentence\" as the score_type and the default parameters of time_matters. In this configuration, multiple occurrences of a temporal expression in different sentences of a given document, will return multiple (eventually different) scores (e.g., 0.2 for its occurrence in document 1; and 0.982 for its occurrence in document 2). Once again, we apply the `year` granularity to avoid getting too many fine-grained temporal expressions. Yet, you are more than welcome to alternatively run the following code: `results = Time_Matters_MultipleDocs(ListOfDocs, score_type='ByDocSentence')`."

       "{0: 'The <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> <kw>bombing</kw> was a terrorist <kw>attack</kw>, followed by subsequent related shootings, that occurred when two pressure cooker <kw>bombs</kw> exploded during the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> on <d>2013</d>. The <kw>bombs</kw> exploded <d>PT12S</d> and 210 <kw>yards</kw> (190 m) apart at <d>2013</d> <kw>edt</kw>, near the marathon\\'s <kw>finish</kw> <kw>line</kw> on <kw>boylston</kw> <kw>street</kw>. The <kw>explosion</kw> killed 3 civilians and injured an estimated 264 others. The <kw>federal</kw> Bureau of <kw>investigation</kw> (<kw>fbi</kw>) took over the <kw>investigation</kw> and, on <d>2013</d>, released photographs and a surveillance <kw>video</kw> of two <kw>suspects</kw>. The <kw>suspects</kw> were <kw>identified</kw> later that day as Chechen brothers <kw>dzhokhar</kw> <kw>tsarnaev</kw> and <kw>tamerlan</kw> <kw>tsarnaev</kw>. Shortly after the <kw>fbi</kw> released identifying images publicly, the <kw>suspects</kw> killed an MIT policeman, carjacked a civilian SUV, and initiated an exchange of gunfire with the <kw>police</kw> in nearby Watertown. During the firefight, a <kw>massachusetts</kw> Bay Transportation Authority <kw>police</kw> officer was injured but survived with severe blood loss. A <kw>boston</kw> <kw>police</kw> Department officer was also injured and died from his wounds <d>2014</d>. <kw>tamerlan</kw> <kw>tsarnaev</kw> was shot several times in the firefight and his brother subsequently ran him over with the stolen SUV in his escape. <kw>tamerlan</kw> died shortly after arriving at Boston\\'s Beth Israel <kw>hospital</kw>. An unprecedented <kw>manhunt</kw> for <kw>dzhokhar</kw> <kw>tsarnaev</kw> ensued on <d>2013</d>, with <kw>thousands</kw> of <kw>law</kw> <kw>enforcement</kw> officers searching a 20-block <kw>area</kw> of Watertown. During the <kw>manhunt</kw>, <kw>authorities</kw> <kw>asked</kw> residents of Watertown and surrounding areas, including <kw>boston</kw>, to stay indoors. The <kw>public</kw> transportation system and most businesses and <kw>public</kw> institutions were shut down, creating a deserted urban environment of historic size and duration. <d>2013</d>, shortly after the \"shelter-in-place\" advisory was rescinded, a Watertown resident discovered <kw>dzhokhar</kw> hiding in a boat in his back yard. <kw>reports</kw> conflict as to whether or not he was armed. <kw>located</kw> within the boat by thermal imaging, he was shot while in the boat, arrested, and then taken to a <kw>hospital</kw> shortly thereafter. During an initial interrogation in the <kw>hospital</kw>, <kw>dzhokhar</kw> alleged that <kw>tamerlan</kw> was the mastermind. He said they were motivated by extremist Islamist beliefs and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and that they were self-radicalized and unconnected to any outside terrorist groups. According to him, they <kw>learned</kw> to build explosive <kw>devices</kw> from an online magazine of the al-Qaeda affiliate in Yemen. He said that he and his brother had decided after the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>bombing</kw> to travel to New York City to bomb Times <kw>square</kw>. <kw>dzhokhar</kw> was indicted on <d>2013</d>, while still in the <kw>hospital</kw>, on 30 charges relating to homegrown <kw>terrorism</kw>, including use of a <kw>weapon</kw> of <kw>mass</kw> <kw>destruction</kw> and malicious <kw>destruction</kw> of property resulting in death. He was <kw>found</kw> guilty on all charges on <d>2015</d>, and <d>2015</d> was sentenced to death. On <d>2012</d>, <d>2013</d>, the 117th annual <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> began without any signs of an imminent <kw>attack</kw>. <kw>officials</kw> swept the <kw>area</kw> for <kw>bombs</kw> twice before the <kw>explosions</kw>; the second sweep occurred <d>PT1H</d> before the <kw>bombs</kw> went off. <kw>people</kw> were able to come and go freely and carry bags and <kw>items</kw> in and out of the <kw>area</kw>. At <d>2013</d> <kw>edt</kw> (18:49 UTC), <d>PT3H</d> after the winner crossed the <kw>finish</kw> <kw>line</kw>, but with more than 5,700 <kw>runners</kw> yet to <kw>finish</kw>, two <kw>bombs</kw> detonated on <kw>boylston</kw> <kw>street</kw> near <kw>copley</kw> <kw>square</kw> about 210 <kw>yards</kw> (190 m) apart, just before the <kw>finish</kw> <kw>line</kw>. The first exploded outside <kw>marathon</kw> Sports at 671–673 <kw>boylston</kw> <kw>street</kw> at <d>2013</d> <kw>edt</kw>. At the time of the first <kw>explosion</kw>, the race clock at the <kw>finish</kw> <kw>line</kw> showed 04:09:43, reflecting the elapsed time since the Wave 3 start at <d>2013</d> <kw>edt</kw>. The second bomb exploded at <d>2013</d> <kw>edt</kw>, <d>PT13S</d> later and one block farther west at 755 <kw>boylston</kw> <kw>street</kw>. The <kw>blasts</kw> blew out windows on adjacent buildings but did not cause any structural damage. Some <kw>runners</kw> continued to cross the <kw>line</kw> until <d>2013</d> <kw>edt</kw>, <d>PT8M</d> after the <kw>explosions</kw>. Rescue workers and medical personnel, on hand to assist <kw>runners</kw> and bystanders, rushed available aid to wounded victims in the bombing\\'s immediate aftermath. Additional emergency units from <kw>boston</kw> EMS, the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>police</kw> Department, and the <kw>boston</kw> Fire Department were dispatched to assist emergency responders already on-scene. A mutual aid request was sent and additional private ambulances responded. The <kw>explosions</kw> killed 3 civilians and injured an estimated 264 others, who were treated in 27 local hospitals. At least 14 <kw>people</kw> required amputations, with some suffering traumatic amputations as a direct result of the <kw>blasts</kw>. The <kw>marathon</kw> was halted abruptly. <kw>boston</kw> <kw>police</kw>, following emergency plans, diverted the remaining <kw>runners</kw> away from the <kw>finish</kw> <kw>line</kw> to <kw>boston</kw> <kw>common</kw> and Kenmore <kw>square</kw>. The nearby <kw>lenox</kw> Hotel and other buildings were <kw>evacuated</kw>. <kw>police</kw> closed down a 15-block <kw>area</kw> around the blast site; this was reduced to a 12-block <kw>crime</kw> <kw>scene</kw> on <d>2013</d>. <kw>massachusetts</kw> Army National Guard soldiers already at the <kw>scene</kw> joined local <kw>authorities</kw> in rendering aid. <kw>boston</kw> <kw>police</kw> commissioner Edward F. <kw>davis</kw> recommended that <kw>people</kw> stay off the streets. Many civilians dropped backpacks and other bags as they fled, requiring each to be treated as a potential bomb. A number of news <kw>reports</kw> stated that more <kw>bombs</kw> had been <kw>found</kw> nearby and the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>police</kw> Bomb Squad said they would perform a controlled <kw>explosion</kw> on the 600 block of <kw>boylston</kw> <kw>street</kw>, but in the end no other <kw>bombs</kw> were <kw>found</kw>. Some <kw>media</kw> outlets also <kw>reported</kw> a potential <kw>bombing</kw> at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library in the Dorchester section of the city, but this turned out to be an unrelated electrical fire. The Navy sent one of its EOD (Explosive Ordinance Disposal) to <kw>boston</kw> to help local <kw>authorities</kw>. As a precaution, the <kw>federal</kw> Aviation Administration restricted airspace over <kw>boston</kw>, and issued a temporary ground stop for Boston\\'s Logan International Airport. Some <kw>massachusetts</kw> Bay Transportation Authority service was halted. Several cities in <kw>massachusetts</kw> and other states put their <kw>police</kw> forces on alert. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder directed that the \"full resources\" of the U.S. Department of <kw>justice</kw> be brought to bear on investigating the <kw>explosions</kw>. The <kw>massachusetts</kw> Emergency Management Agency suggested <kw>people</kw> trying to contact those in the vicinity use text messaging instead of voice calls because of crowded cellphone lines. Cellphone service in <kw>boston</kw> was congested but remained in operation, despite some local <kw>media</kw> <kw>reports</kw> stating that cell service was shut down to prevent cell phones from being used as detonators. The <kw>american</kw> Red Cross helped concerned friends and family receive information about <kw>runners</kw> and casualties. The <kw>boston</kw> <kw>police</kw> Department also set up a helpline for <kw>people</kw> concerned about relatives or acquaintances to contact and a <kw>line</kw> for <kw>people</kw> to provide information. Google Person Finder activated their disaster service under <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> <kw>explosions</kw> to log known information about missing persons as a publicly viewable file Because of the closure of several <kw>hotels</kw> near the blast zone, some out-of-town visitors were <kw>left</kw> with nowhere to stay; many Boston-area residents opened their homes to them. The <kw>federal</kw> Bureau of <kw>investigation</kw> led the <kw>investigation</kw>, assisted by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Counterterrorism Center, and the Drug <kw>enforcement</kw> Administration, and named two <kw>official</kw> <kw>suspects</kw>. <kw>united</kw> States government <kw>officials</kw> stated that there had been no intelligence <kw>reports</kw> that indicated such a <kw>bombing</kw> would take place. Representative Peter King, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, said: \"I received two top secret briefings <d>2013</d> on the <d>PRESENT_REF</d> threat levels in the <kw>united</kw> States, and there was no evidence of this at all.\" Following the identification of the <kw>suspects</kw>, their father claimed that the <kw>fbi</kw> had been watching his family and questioned his sons in Cambridge, <kw>massachusetts</kw>, five times in relation to possible <kw>explosions</kw> on the streets of <kw>boston</kw>. At the site of the <kw>explosion</kw>, investigators <kw>found</kw> shrapnel that included bits of metal, nails, and bearing balls, as well as black nylon pieces from a backpack. The lid of a pressure cooker was <kw>found</kw> on a nearby rooftop. Investigators also <kw>found</kw> the remains of an electronic circuit board and wiring. All evidence was sent to the <kw>fbi</kw> Laboratory for analysis. Both of the improvised explosive <kw>devices</kw> were pressure cooker <kw>bombs</kw>, manufactured by the <kw>bombers</kw>. <kw>authorities</kw> reportedly confirmed that the brothers used bomb making instructions <kw>found</kw> in Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula\\'s Inspire. After the <kw>suspects</kw> were <kw>identified</kw>, The <kw>boston</kw> <kw>globe</kw> <kw>reported</kw> that <kw>tamerlan</kw> purchased fireworks from a fireworks store in New Hampshire. On <d>2013</d>, the <kw>fbi</kw>, West New York <kw>police</kw> Department, and Hudson County Sheriff\\'s Department seized computer equipment from the suspects\\' sister\\'s apartment <kw>located</kw> in West New York, New Jersey. On <d>2013</d>, the <kw>fbi</kw> and the Department of Homeland <kw>security</kw> released a joint intelligence bulletin which the Los Angeles Times <kw>reports</kw> to include the \"preliminary analysis of recovered evidence, [for] each device\". The report says investigators believe that the two homemade <kw>bombs</kw> used were triggered by long-range remote controls used for toy cars; and that investigators have finished a preliminary reconstruction of the <kw>bombs</kw> that were used during the <d>2013</d> <kw>attacks</kw>. In a news conference held at <d>2013</d> on <d>2013</d>, the <kw>fbi</kw> released photographs and surveillance <kw>videos</kw> showing two suspects—each carrying a backpack, and walking one behind the other—and sought the public\\'s help in identifying them. The <kw>fbi</kw> released the <kw>photos</kw>, in part, to limit the damage by those wrongly targeted by incorrect news <kw>reports</kw> and <kw>social</kw> <kw>media</kw> speculations. <kw>authorities</kw> later said that releasing the suspects\\' <kw>photos</kw> \"was a turning point in the <kw>investigation</kw>, no doubt about it.\" Jeff Bauman, a victim who lost both legs, was adjacent to the location of one of the <kw>bombs</kw>; upon recovering consciousness, he <kw>asked</kw> for pen and paper and wrote a note to the <kw>fbi</kw>, \"bag, saw the guy, looked right at me\". Bauman was later able to provide detailed descriptions to the <kw>authorities</kw> of a <kw>suspect</kw> who was seen placing a backpack beside him at the <kw>bombing</kw> <kw>scene</kw> two and a <kw>half</kw> minutes before it exploded, enabling the photo to be <kw>identified</kw> and circulated quickly. The <kw>suspects</kw>, initially <kw>identified</kw> by the <kw>fbi</kw> as unnamed <kw>suspects</kw> 1 and 2 (or \"black hat\" and \"white hat\", respectively) from photographic and <kw>video</kw> evidence, had \"acted differently\" after the <kw>explosions</kw>; they had stayed to watch the aftermath and walked away \"casually\", rather than fleeing. <kw>asked</kw> for assistance in identifying the <kw>suspects</kw>, the <kw>public</kw> provided a deluge of photographs and home movie records to <kw>police</kw>, which were scrutinized by both <kw>authorities</kw> and online <kw>public</kw> <kw>social</kw> networks. Despite <kw>video</kw> footage taken at the <kw>scene</kw>, the <kw>suspects</kw> were not <kw>identified</kw> by <kw>authorities</kw> before killing a <kw>police</kw> officer and hijacking a civilian vehicle. The source of identification was RMV records on the Honda vehicle, which was used in a subsequent kidnapping and then abandoned. The <kw>suspects</kw> were then <kw>identified</kw> as two brothers whose family had immigrated to the <kw>united</kw> States as asylees around <d>2002</d>: 26-year-old <kw>tamerlan</kw> <kw>tsarnaev</kw> and 19-year-old <kw>dzhokhar</kw> <kw>tsarnaev</kw>. <d>PTXH</d> after the <kw>photos</kw> were released, the <kw>suspects</kw> shot Sean A. Collier of the <kw>massachusetts</kw> <kw>institute</kw> of Technology <kw>police</kw> Department six times, killing him for his gun, which they could not get out because of the holster\\'s retention system. Collier, aged 27, was seated in his <kw>police</kw> car near the Stata Center (Building 32), on the <kw>massachusetts</kw> <kw>institute</kw> of Technology campus. He was taken to <kw>massachusetts</kw> General <kw>hospital</kw> in nearby <kw>downtown</kw> <kw>boston</kw>, where he was pronounced dead. Some <kw>law</kw> <kw>enforcement</kw> <kw>officials</kw> described the killing as an assassination. The duo then carjacked a Mercedes-Benz M-Class SUV in the Allston-Brighton neighborhood of <kw>boston</kw>; <kw>tamerlan</kw> took the owner hostage and <kw>told</kw> him that he was responsible for the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>bombing</kw> and for killing a <kw>police</kw> officer. <kw>dzhokhar</kw> followed them in the green Honda, later joining them in the Mercedes-Benz. Interrogation later allegedly revealed that the brothers \"decided spontaneously\" that they wanted to go to New York and bomb Times <kw>square</kw>. The <kw>suspects</kw> forced the hostage to use his ATM cards to obtain $800 in cash until the daily cash withdrawal limit was reached. They transferred objects to the Mercedes-Benz and one brother followed it in their Honda Civic, for which an all-points bulletin was issued. The car\\'s owner, a <kw>chinese</kw> national named Dun Meng (referred to only as \"Danny\" in early <kw>reports</kw>), escaped while the <kw>suspects</kw> stopped at a gas station; he ran across the <kw>street</kw> to another gas station, asking the clerk to <kw>call</kw> 911. His cellphone remained in the vehicle, allowing the <kw>police</kw> to focus their search on Watertown. Shortly after midnight on <d>2013</d>, a Watertown <kw>police</kw> officer, Joseph Reynolds, <kw>identified</kw> the brothers in a Honda Civic and the stolen SUV. A gunfight followed on the 100 block of Laurel St, between the brothers and <kw>police</kw> arriving at the <kw>scene</kw>. An estimated 200 to 300 rounds of ammunition were fired and at least one further bomb and several \"crude grenades\" were thrown. According to Watertown <kw>police</kw> Chief Edward Deveau, the brothers had an \"arsenal of guns.\" The older brother, <kw>tamerlan</kw>, ran out of ammunition and threw his empty pistol at Sergeant Jeffrey Pugliese, who tackled him with assistance from Sergeant John MacLellan. The younger brother <kw>dzhokhar</kw> then drove the stolen SUV toward <kw>police</kw> and <kw>tamerlan</kw>; Pugliese attempted to drag <kw>tamerlan</kw> to safety at danger of his own life, but was unsuccessful. <kw>dzhokhar</kw> ran over his brother, dragging him a short distance down the <kw>street</kw>. <kw>dzhokhar</kw> <kw>tsarnaev</kw> sped off, but about a half-mile away at the corner of Spruce and Lincoln streets he abandoned the car and escaped on foot. Upon searching the <kw>scene</kw>, only one firearm, a Ruger 9 mm pistol with a defaced serial number, was recovered. Within a <d>PT10M</d> span, officers fired many rounds, peppering the <kw>area</kw> and leaving over a dozen nearby houses with scores of bullet holes. <kw>tamerlan</kw> <kw>tsarnaev</kw> was transported to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead on <d>2013</d> at <d>2013</d> According to the death certificate, Tsarnaev\\'s cause of death was \"gunshot wounds of torso and extremities, blunt trauma to head and torso,\" and \"shot by <kw>police</kw> then run over and dragged by motor vehicle.\" The death was ruled a homicide. During the firefight, 33-year-old MBTA <kw>police</kw> Officer Richard H. Donohue Jr. was also critically wounded by what may have been friendly fire. He was taken to Mount Auburn <kw>hospital</kw> with a bullet wound to the thigh and life-threatening blood loss, but he survived. <kw>boston</kw> <kw>police</kw> Department officer Dennis Simmonds died on <d>2014</d>, as a result of injuries he sustained from a hand grenade at the Watertown shootout, bringing the total number of fatalities to five. Fifteen other <kw>police</kw> officers sustained minor injuries during the firefight,. A 50-page report on the <kw>manhunt</kw> produced by Harvard Kennedy School\\'s Program on Crisis Leadership <kw>found</kw> that a lack of coordination between the <kw>police</kw> agencies involved put the <kw>public</kw> at excessive risk during the shootout. The <kw>fbi</kw> released additional <kw>photos</kw> of the two during the Watertown incident. Early on <d>2013</d>, Watertown residents received reverse 911 calls asking them to stay indoors. On <d>2013</d>, Governor Patrick <kw>asked</kw> residents of Watertown and adjacent cities and towns (Allston-Brighton, <kw>boston</kw>, Belmont, Brookline, Cambridge, Newton, and Waltham) to \"shelter in place\". Somerville residents also received a reverse-911 <kw>call</kw> with orders to shelter in place. A 20-block <kw>area</kw> of Watertown was cordoned off and residents were <kw>told</kw> not to leave their homes or answer the door as officers in tactical gear scoured the <kw>area</kw>. Helicopters circled the <kw>area</kw> and SWAT teams in armored vehicles moved through in formation, with officers going door-to-door. On the <kw>scene</kw> were the <kw>fbi</kw>, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Department of Homeland <kw>security</kw>, the National Guard, the <kw>boston</kw> and Watertown <kw>police</kw> departments and the <kw>massachusetts</kw> State <kw>police</kw>. The show of force was the first major field test of the interagency task forces created in the wake of the <d>2012</d> <kw>attacks</kw>. The entire <kw>public</kw> transit network, as well as most <kw>boston</kw> taxi service, was suspended, as was Amtrak service to and from <kw>boston</kw>. Logan International Airport remained open under heightened <kw>security</kw>. Universities, schools, many businesses, and other facilities were closed as <kw>thousands</kw> of <kw>law</kw> <kw>enforcement</kw> personnel participated in an unprecedented door-to-door <kw>manhunt</kw> in Watertown, as well as following up other leads, including at the house the brothers shared in Cambridge. Seven improvised explosive <kw>devices</kw> were recovered by bomb squads. The father of the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> <kw>bombers</kw>, speaking from his home in Makhachkala, Dagestan, encouraged his son to: \"Give up. Give up. You have a bright future ahead of you. Come home to Russia.\" He continued, \"If they killed him, then all hell would break loose.\" On television, Dzhokhar\\'s uncle from Montgomery Village, Maryland, pleaded with him to turn himself in. The <kw>manhunt</kw> <kw>ended</kw> on <d>2013</d>, <d>PT2H</d> after the shelter-in-place order had been lifted. Outside the search <kw>area</kw>, a Watertown resident stepped outside and noticed that the cover on his boat in his back yard was loose. He looked into the boat and saw a body lying in a pool of blood, and he promptly notified <kw>police</kw>. <kw>authorities</kw> surrounded the boat and verified movement through a forward looking infrared thermal imaging device in a State <kw>police</kw> helicopter. When the <kw>suspect</kw> started poking at the tarp of the boat, <kw>police</kw> began a large volume of gunfire at the boat, stopping only after the Superintendent on the <kw>scene</kw> called for a cease fire. Celebrations followed <kw>law</kw> enforcement\\'s capture of <kw>tsarnaev</kw>. According to <kw>boston</kw> <kw>police</kw> Commissioner Ed <kw>davis</kw>, and Watertown <kw>police</kw> Chief Deveau, <kw>tsarnaev</kw> was shooting from inside the boat at <kw>police</kw>, \"exchanging fire for <d>PT1H</d>.\" After he was captured, <kw>tsarnaev</kw> was <kw>found</kw> not to have any weapons. He was taken into custody at <d>2013</d> and transported to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, where he was listed in critical condition with multiple gunshot wounds to the head, neck, legs and hand. Initial <kw>reports</kw> that the neck wound was from a self-inflicted gunshot from a possible suicide attempt were later contradicted by the revelation that he was unarmed at the time of capture and a description of the neck wound by SWAT team members that the neck wound was a slicing injury, possibly caused by shrapnel from an <kw>explosion</kw>. <kw>united</kw> States Senators Kelly Ayotte, Saxby Chambliss, Lindsey Graham, and John McCain, and Representative Peter T. King, suggested that <kw>dzhokhar</kw> <kw>tsarnaev</kw>, a U.S. citizen, should be tried as an unlawful enemy combatant rather than as a criminal, potentially preventing him from obtaining legal counsel. Other sources, including Alan Dershowitz, a prominent <kw>american</kw> legal scholar and lawyer, said that doing so would be illegal and would jeopardize the prosecution. The government decided to try <kw>dzhokhar</kw> in the <kw>federal</kw> criminal court system and not as an enemy combatant. <kw>dzhokhar</kw> was questioned for <d>PT16H</d> by investigators but stopped communicating with them on <d>2013</d> after Judge Marianne Bowler read him a Miranda <kw>warning</kw>. <kw>dzhokhar</kw> had not previously been given a Miranda <kw>warning</kw>, as <kw>federal</kw> <kw>law</kw> <kw>enforcement</kw> <kw>officials</kw> invoked the warning\\'s <kw>public</kw> safety exception. This raised doubts whether the suspect\\'s statements during this <kw>investigation</kw> would be admissible as evidence and led to a debate surrounding Miranda rights. On <d>2013</d>, formal criminal charges were brought against <kw>tsarnaev</kw> in the <kw>united</kw> States District Court for the District of <kw>massachusetts</kw> during a bedside hearing while he was hospitalized. He was <kw>charged</kw> with use of a <kw>weapon</kw> of <kw>mass</kw> <kw>destruction</kw>, and with malicious <kw>destruction</kw> of property resulting in death. Some of the charges carry potential sentences of life imprisonment or the death penalty. <kw>tsarnaev</kw> was judged to be awake, mentally competent, and lucid, and he responded to most questions by nodding. When the judge <kw>asked</kw> him whether he was able to afford an attorney, he responded \"no\"; he was represented by the <kw>federal</kw> <kw>public</kw> Defender\\'s office. On <d>2013</d>, Dzhohkar <kw>tsarnaev</kw> was moved from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center to the <kw>federal</kw> Medical Center at Fort Devens, about 40 miles (64 km) from <kw>boston</kw>. FMC Devens is a <kw>federal</kw> prison medical facility at a former Army base where he was held in solitary confinement at a segregated housing unit with <d>PT23H</d>-per-day lockdown. On <d>2013</d>, <kw>tsarnaev</kw> pleaded not guilty to 30 charges in his first <kw>public</kw> court appearance, including a murder charge for MIT <kw>police</kw> officer Sean Collier. He was back in court for a status hearing on <d>2012</d>, and his lawyers requested more time to prepare their defense. On <d>2012</d>, Tsarnaev\\'s attorneys <kw>asked</kw> the court to lift the special administrative measures (SAMs) imposed by Attorney General Holder in <d>2012</d>, saying the measures had <kw>left</kw> <kw>tsarnaev</kw> unduly isolated from communication with his family and lawyers, and that no evidence suggests he poses a future threat. Judge George O\\'Toole ruled on <d>2014</d>, that the <kw>trial</kw> would begin on <d>2015</d>, <d>2015</d> than planned, due to the extensive amount of evidence needed to be examined by both sides. He said the defense motion for a lengthier delay, until <d>2015</d>, was not warranted. He also ruled that the defense had failed to demonstrate that <kw>media</kw> <kw>coverage</kw> had \"so inflamed and pervasively prejudiced the [potential <kw>area</kw> jury] pool that a fair and impartial jury could not be empaneled in the district\", refusing their request for a change of venue to Washington, D.C. On <d>2014</d>, <kw>tsarnaev</kw> attended a pre-trial hearing, his first time in <kw>public</kw> since <d>2013</d>. The jury selection began on <d>2015</d>, with an initial pool of 1373 prospective jurors filling out questionnaires. On <d>2013</d>, Judge George O\\'Toole, along with the prosecution and defense teams, settled on a pool of 70 jury prospects after questioning 256 <kw>people</kw> <d>P21D</d> of individual interviews. On <d>2015</d>, the jury, composed of eight <kw>men</kw> and 10 women (six of which were alternates), was selected. The <kw>trial</kw> began in <kw>federal</kw> court in <kw>boston</kw> on <d>2015</d>, with opening statements. Assistant U.S. Attorney William Weinreb, speaking for the prosecution, vividly described the <kw>scene</kw> of the <kw>bombing</kw> and attempted to paint <kw>dzhokhar</kw> as \"a soldier in a holy war against <kw>americans</kw>\" whose motive was \"reaching paradise\", and that he acted as an equal participant. Defense attorney Judy Clarke declared in her opening statement that \"It was him\"—that it was <kw>dzhokhar</kw> <kw>tsarnaev</kw> who had placed the second bomb at the <kw>finish</kw> <kw>line</kw> and was present at the murder of Sean Collier, at the carjacking of Dun Meng, and at the Watertown shootout, but she then laid out an argument aimed at saving <kw>tsarnaev</kw> from the death penalty by showing the influence that his older brother had and that <kw>dzhokhar</kw> was merely a follower. Between <d>2013</d> and <d>2013</d>, <kw>prosecutors</kw> called more than 90 witnesses <d>P15D</d> of testimony, including <kw>bombing</kw> survivors who described losing limbs in the <kw>attack</kw>, and the government rested its case on <d>2013</d>. On <d>2013</d>, after calling four witnesses overall, the defense team representing <kw>tsarnaev</kw> finished presenting its case in the guilt phase. Following closing statements on <d>2013</d>, <kw>tsarnaev</kw> was <kw>found</kw> guilty on all 30 counts as the verdict was reached on <d>2015</d>. It took <d>PT26M</d> to read the verdict that included convictions on weapons, <kw>bombing</kw>, conspiracy, and murder charges. Of the 30 counts, 17 carry the possibility of the death penalty. The sentencing phase of the <kw>trial</kw> was on <d>2013</d>. On <d>2015</d>, <kw>tsarnaev</kw> was formally sentenced to death after he apologized to the victims for the <kw>bombings</kw>. According to <kw>fbi</kw> interrogators, <kw>dzhokhar</kw> and his brother were motivated by extremist Islamic beliefs, but \"were not connected to any known terrorist groups\"; instead learning to build explosive weapons from an online magazine published by al-Qaeda affiliates in Yemen. They further alleged that \"[Dzhokhar and] his brother considered suicide <kw>attacks</kw> and striking on <d>2012</d>; but ultimately decided to use pressure cooker <kw>bombs</kw> (capable of remote detonation) and other IEDs.\" Fox News <kw>reported</kw> that the brothers \"chose the prestigious race as a \\'target of opportunity\\' ... [after] the building of the <kw>bombs</kw> came together more quickly than expected\". <kw>dzhokhar</kw> said he and his brother wanted to defend <kw>islam</kw> from the U.S., which conducted the Iraq War and War in Afghanistan, in the view of the brothers, against <kw>muslims</kw>. Later a CBS report revealed that a note scrawled by <kw>dzhokhar</kw> with a marker on the interior wall of the boat where he was hiding said the <kw>bombing</kw> were \"retribution for U.S. military action in Afghanistan and Iraq\", and called the <kw>boston</kw> victims \"collateral damage\", \"in the same way innocent victims have been collateral damage in U.S. wars around the world.\" According to The New York Times, the portion of the boat\\'s interior with the note would likely be cut from the hull with permission from the owner and presented in court as evidence. Despite the seemingly outwardly religious motivation of the <kw>tsarnaev</kw> brothers, some political science and <kw>public</kw> policy scholars suggest that <kw>islam</kw> may have played only a secondary role in the <kw>attacks</kw>. Sympathy towards the political aspirations in the Caucasus region and Tamerlan\\'s inability to become fully integrated into <kw>american</kw> society appear to be the primary motives, in their opinion. According to The Los Angeles Times, a <kw>law</kw> <kw>enforcement</kw> <kw>official</kw> said <kw>dzhokhar</kw> \"did not seem as bothered about America\\'s role in the Muslim world\" as his brother <kw>tamerlan</kw> had been. <kw>dzhokhar</kw> <kw>identified</kw> <kw>tamerlan</kw> as the \"driving force\" behind the <kw>bombing</kw>, and said that his brother had only <d>PAST_REF</d> recruited him to help. <kw>tamerlan</kw> <kw>tsarnaev</kw> was born in <d>1986</d> in the Kalmyk Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, North Caucasus. <kw>dzhokhar</kw> was born in <d>1993</d> in Kyrgyzstan, although some <kw>reports</kw> say his family claims he was born in Dagestan. The family spent time in Tokmok, Kyrgyzstan, and in Makhachkala, Dagestan. They are <kw>half</kw> Chechen through their father, Anzor, and <kw>half</kw> Avar through their mother, Zubeidat. Although they never lived in Chechnya, the brothers self-identified as Chechen. The <kw>tsarnaev</kw> family emigrated in <d>2002</d> to the <kw>united</kw> States, where they applied for political asylum, settling in Cambridge, <kw>massachusetts</kw>. <kw>tamerlan</kw> <kw>tsarnaev</kw> attended Bunker Hill Community College but dropped out to become a boxer. His goal was a place on the U.S. Olympic boxing team saying that \"unless his native Chechnya becomes independent\" he would \"rather compete for the <kw>united</kw> States than for Russia\". He was married on <d>2010</d>, in the Masjid Al Quran Mosque in the Dorchester section of the city, to a U.S. citizen, Katherine Russell, who was pregnant with their daughter. He stated that he \"didn\\'t understand\" <kw>americans</kw> and had not a single <kw>american</kw> <kw>friend</kw>. He had a <kw>history</kw> of violence, including an arrest in <d>2009</d> for assaulting his then-girlfriend. The brothers are Muslim, with Tamerlan\\'s aunt stating that he had <d>PAST_REF</d> become a devout Muslim. <kw>tamerlan</kw>, since <d>2009</d>, became more devout and religious, and a YouTube channel in his name linked to Salafist and Islamist <kw>videos</kw>. The <kw>fbi</kw> was informed by the Russian <kw>federal</kw> <kw>security</kw> Service (FSB) in <d>2011</d> that he was a \"follower of <kw>radical</kw> <kw>islam</kw>.\" In response, the <kw>fbi</kw> interviewed <kw>tamerlan</kw> and his family, and searched databases, but did not find any evidence of \"<kw>terrorism</kw> activity, domestic or foreign.\" During the <d>2012</d> trip to Dagestan, <kw>tamerlan</kw> was reportedly a frequent visitor at a mosque on Kotrova <kw>street</kw> in Makhachkala, believed by the FSB to be linked with <kw>radical</kw> <kw>islam</kw>. Some experts believe \"they were motivated by their faith, apparently an anti-American, <kw>radical</kw> version of <kw>islam</kw>\" acquired in the U.S., while others believe the turn to radicalism happened in Dagestan. At the time of the <kw>bombing</kw>, <kw>dzhokhar</kw> <kw>tsarnaev</kw> was a student at the <kw>university</kw> of <kw>massachusetts</kw> <kw>dartmouth</kw>, with a major in marine biology. <kw>dzhokhar</kw> became a naturalized U.S. citizen on <d>2012</d>. Tamerlan\\'s boxing coach <kw>reported</kw> to NBC that the young brother was greatly affected by his brother and admired him. <kw>tamerlan</kw> <kw>tsarnaev</kw> was previously connected, but at the time not a <kw>suspect</kw>, to the triple homicide in Waltham, <kw>massachusetts</kw>, on <d>2011</d>. Brendan Mess, Erik Weissman and Raphael Teken were murdered in Mess\\'s apartment. All had their throats slit from ear to ear, with such great force that they were nearly decapitated. The local district attorney said that it appeared that the killer and the victims knew each other, and that the murders were not random. <kw>tamerlan</kw> <kw>tsarnaev</kw> had previously described murder victim Brendan Mess as his \"best <kw>friend</kw>.\" After the <kw>bombing</kw> and subsequent revelations of Tsarnaev\\'s personal life, the Waltham murders case was reexamined in <d>2013</d> with <kw>tsarnaev</kw> as a new <kw>suspect</kw>. Both ABC and The New York Times have <kw>reported</kw> that there is strong evidence that implicates <kw>tsarnaev</kw> in this triple homicide. Some analysts claim the <kw>tsarnaev</kw> brothers\\' mother, Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, is a <kw>radical</kw> extremist and supporter of jihad, who influenced her sons\\' behavior. This prompted the Russian government to warn the U.S. government about the family\\'s behavior, on two occasions. Both <kw>tamerlan</kw> and his mother were placed on a <kw>terrorism</kw> watch list <d>P18M</d> before the <kw>bombing</kw> took place. According to a Wall <kw>street</kw> Journal report citing statements by anonymous U.S. <kw>officials</kw>, Russia denied U.S. requests for more information after its initial <kw>warning</kw>. Other arrests, detentions, and prosecutions On <d>2013</d>, several <kw>people</kw> who were near the <kw>scene</kw> of the blast were taken into custody and questioned about the <kw>bombing</kw>, including a Saudi <kw>man</kw> whom <kw>police</kw> stopped as he was walking away from the <kw>explosion</kw>, and detained when some of his responses to questions \"<kw>made</kw> them uncomfortable.\" <kw>law</kw> <kw>enforcement</kw> searched his residence in a <kw>boston</kw> suburb. The <kw>man</kw> was <kw>found</kw> to have no connection to the <kw>attack</kw>; an unnamed U.S. <kw>official</kw> said, \"he was just at the wrong place at the wrong time.\" On <d>2013</d>, two <kw>men</kw> riding in a taxi in the vicinity of the shootout were arrested and released shortly thereafter when <kw>police</kw> determined they were not involved in the <kw>marathon</kw> <kw>attacks</kw>. Another <kw>man</kw> was arrested several blocks from the site of the shootout and was forced to strip naked by <kw>police</kw> who feared he might have concealed explosives. He was released that evening after a brief <kw>investigation</kw> determined that he was an innocent bystander. On <d>2012</d>, the <kw>fbi</kw> interrogated Ibragim Todashev, a Chechen from <kw>boston</kw>, in <kw>orlando</kw>, Florida. During the interrogation he was shot and killed by an <kw>fbi</kw> agent who claimed that Todashev attacked him. The New York Times quoted an unnamed <kw>law</kw> <kw>enforcement</kw> <kw>official</kw> as saying that Todashev had confessed to a triple homicide and implicated <kw>tsarnaev</kw> as well. Todashev\\'s father claims that his son is innocent and that <kw>federal</kw> investigators are biased against Chechens and <kw>made</kw> up their case against him. Robel Phillipos, 19, was a U.S. citizen of Ethiopian descent living in Cambridge, was arrested and faced charges of knowingly making false statements to <kw>police</kw>. He graduated from high school in <d>2011</d> with <kw>dzhokhar</kw> <kw>tsarnaev</kw>. Dias <kw>kadyrbayev</kw>, 19, and <kw>azamat</kw> <kw>tazhayakov</kw>, 20, were Kazakhstan natives living in the U.S. They were <kw>dzhokhar</kw> Tsarnaev\\'s roommates in an off-campus housing complex at which <kw>tsarnaev</kw> had sometimes stayed in New Bedford, <kw>massachusetts</kw>. Phillipos, <kw>kadyrbayev</kw>, <kw>tazhayakov</kw>, and <kw>tsarnaev</kw> entered the <kw>university</kw> of <kw>massachusetts</kw> <kw>dartmouth</kw> in <d>2011</d> and knew each other well. After seeing <kw>photos</kw> of the as-yet unidentified <kw>tsarnaev</kw> on television, the three <kw>men</kw> traveled to Tsarnaev\\'s <kw>dorm</kw> <kw>room</kw>, where they retrieved a backpack and laptop belonging to <kw>tsarnaev</kw>. The backpack was discarded, but <kw>police</kw> recovered the backpack and contents in a nearby New Bedford landfill on <d>2013</d>. During interviews, the <kw>men</kw> initially denied visiting the <kw>dorm</kw> <kw>room</kw> but later admitted their actions. During <d>2013</d>–<d>2013</d>, <kw>kadyrbayev</kw> and <kw>tazhayakov</kw> were arrested by <kw>police</kw> at the off-campus housing complex. An unidentified girlfriend of one of the <kw>men</kw> was also arrested. All three were soon released. On <d>2013</d>, <kw>kadyrbayev</kw> and <kw>tazhayakov</kw> were re-arrested in New Bedford, and held on immigration-related violations. On <d>2012</d>, they appeared before a <kw>federal</kw> immigration judge and were <kw>charged</kw> with overstaying their student visas. <d>2012</d>, <kw>kadyrbayev</kw> and <kw>tazhayakov</kw> were <kw>charged</kw> criminally with: willfully conspir(ing) with each other to commit an offense against the <kw>united</kw> States ... by knowingly destroying, concealing and covering up objects belonging to <kw>dzhokhar</kw> <kw>tsarnaev</kw>, namely, a backpack containing fireworks and a laptop computer, with the intent to impede, obstruct, and influence the criminal <kw>investigation</kw> of the <kw>marathon</kw> <kw>bombing</kw>. On <d>2013</d>, <kw>kadyrbayev</kw> and <kw>tazhayakov</kw> were indicted by a <kw>federal</kw> grand jury on charges of conspiracy to obstruct <kw>justice</kw> for helping <kw>dzhokhar</kw> <kw>tsarnaev</kw> dispose of a laptop computer, fireworks, and a backpack after the <kw>bombing</kw>. Each faced <d>P25Y</d> in prison, and deportation if convicted. On <d>2014</d>, <kw>tazhayakov</kw> was convicted of obstruction of <kw>justice</kw> and conspiracy. On <d>2014</d>, <kw>kadyrbayev</kw> pleaded guilty to obstruction charges. Sentencing was delayed pending the U.S. Supreme Court\\'s ruling in Yates v. <kw>united</kw> States. In <d>2015</d>, <kw>kadyrbayev</kw> was sentenced to <d>P6Y</d> in prison. <kw>tazhayakov</kw> pleaded not guilty and went to <kw>trial</kw>, arguing that \"<kw>kadyrbayev</kw> was the mastermind behind destroying the evidence and that <kw>tazhayakov</kw> only \\'attempted obstruction.\\'\" Jurors returned a guilty verdict against <kw>tazhayakov</kw>, however, and in <d>2015</d>, <kw>tazhayakov</kw> was sentenced to <d>P42M</d> in prison, which equated to three and a <kw>half</kw> years. Judge Douglas Woodlock gave a lighter sentence to Tazahayakov than to <kw>kadyrbayev</kw>, who was viewed as more culpable. Phillipos was arrested and faced charges of knowingly making false statements to <kw>police</kw>. He was released on $100,000 bail, and placed under house confinement with an ankle bracelet. On <d>2014</d>, Phillipos was convicted on two charges of lying about being in Tsarnaev\\'s <kw>dorm</kw> <kw>room</kw>. He later acknowledged he had been in that <kw>room</kw> while two other friends removed a backpack containing potential evidence relating to the <kw>bombing</kw>. Phillipos faced a maximum sentence of <d>P8Y</d>\\' imprisonment on each count. In <d>2015</d>, U.S. District Judge Douglas P. Woodlock sentenced him to <d>P3Y</d> in prison. Phillipos has filed an appeal. On <d>2014</d>, a <kw>federal</kw> indictment against Khairullozhon Matanov was unsealed, charging him with \"one count of destroying, altering, and falsifying records, documents, and tangible objects in a <kw>federal</kw> <kw>investigation</kw>, specifically information on his computer, and three counts of making materially false, fictitious, and fraudulent statements in a <kw>federal</kw> <kw>terrorism</kw> <kw>investigation</kw>.\" Matanov bought dinner for the two <kw>tsarnaev</kw> brothers <d>PT40M</d> after the <kw>bombing</kw>. After the <kw>tsarnaev</kw> brothers\\' <kw>photos</kw> were released to the <kw>public</kw>, Matanov viewed the <kw>photos</kw> on the <kw>cnn</kw> and <kw>fbi</kw> websites before attempting to reach <kw>dzhokhar</kw>, and then tried to give away his cell phone and delete hundreds of documents from his computer. <kw>prosecutors</kw> said that Matanov attempted to mislead investigators about the nature of his relationship with the brothers and to conceal that he shared the brothers\\' philosophy of violence. Matanov was originally from Kyrgyzstan, came to the U.S. in <d>2010</d> on a student visa, and later claimed asylum. He attended Quincy College for <d>P2Y</d> before dropping out to become a taxicab driver. He was living in Quincy, <kw>massachusetts</kw> at the time of his arrest, and was a <kw>friend</kw> of <kw>tamerlan</kw> <kw>tsarnaev</kw>. In <d>2015</d>, Matanov pleaded guilty to all four counts. In <d>2015</d>, he was sentenced to <d>P30M</d> in prison. Three civilians were killed in the <kw>bombing</kw>: Krystle Marie Campbell, 29, a restaurant manager from Medford, <kw>massachusetts</kw>; Lu Lingzi 23, a <kw>chinese</kw> national and <kw>boston</kw> <kw>university</kw> graduate student from Shenyang, Liaoning; and Martin William Richard, an eight-year-old <kw>boy</kw> from the Dorchester neighborhood of <kw>boston</kw>, who was killed by the second bomb. On <d>2013</d>, at <d>2013</d>, Sean A. Collier, 27, an MIT <kw>police</kw> officer (formerly with the Somerville Auxiliary <kw>police</kw> Department from <d>2006</d> to <d>2009</d>) of Wilmington, <kw>massachusetts</kw>, living in Somerville, <kw>massachusetts</kw>, was ambushed in his <kw>police</kw> car and died from multiple gunshot wounds from the <kw>bombing</kw> <kw>suspects</kw>. <kw>boston</kw> <kw>police</kw> Department officer Dennis Simmonds died on <d>2014</d>, as a result of injuries he sustained from a hand grenade at the Watertown shootout. According to the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>public</kw> Health Commission, 264 civilians were treated at 27 local hospitals. <d>2014</d>, 29 remained hospitalized, one in critical condition. Many victims had lower leg injuries and shrapnel wounds, which indicated the <kw>devices</kw> were low to the ground. At least sixteen civilians lost limbs, at the <kw>scene</kw> or by amputation in a <kw>hospital</kw>, and three lost more than one limb. Doctors described removing \"ball-bearing type\" metallic beads a little larger than BBs, and small carpenter-type nails about 1 to 2.5 centimeters (0.4 to 1 in) long. Similar objects were <kw>found</kw> at the <kw>scene</kw>. The New York Times cited doctors as saying because the <kw>bombs</kw> were low to the ground, they mainly injured legs, ankles and feet instead of fatally injuring abdomens, chests, shoulders and heads. Some victims had perforated eardrums. During a firefight with the <kw>suspects</kw> just after midnight on <d>2013</d>, 33-year-old MBTA <kw>police</kw> officer Richard H. Donohue Jr. was critically wounded. He lost almost all of his blood, and his heart stopped for <d>PT45M</d>, during which time he was kept alive by cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The <kw>boston</kw> <kw>globe</kw> <kw>reported</kw> that Donohue may have been accidentally shot by a fellow officer. Marc Fucarile, who lost his right leg and received severe burns and shrapnel wounds, was the last victim released from <kw>hospital</kw> care, on <d>2013</d>. <kw>law</kw> <kw>enforcement</kw>, local and national politicians, and various heads of state reacted quickly to the <kw>bombing</kw>, generally condemning the act and expressing sympathies for the victims. The One <kw>fund</kw> <kw>boston</kw>, established by <kw>massachusetts</kw> Governor Deval Patrick and <kw>boston</kw> mayor Thomas Menino and administered by attorney Kenneth Feinberg, expects to make distributions to <kw>bombing</kw> victims by <d>2013</d>. \"In my <d>P20Y</d> as mayor, I\\'ve never seen the business community come together so quickly,\" said Mayor Menino. <d>P1W</d> after the <kw>bombing</kw>, crowdfunding websites, such as GoFundMe, GiveForward, FundRazr, YouCaring and Fundly, received more than 23,000 pledges promising more than $2 million for the victims, their families, and others affected by the <kw>bombing</kw>. On <d>2013</d> the <kw>boston</kw> Strong concert at the TD Garden in <kw>boston</kw> benefitted the One <kw>fund</kw>. The concert featured Aerosmith, James Taylor, <kw>boston</kw>, J. Geils Band, Dropkick Murphys, New Kids on the Block, Bell Biv DeVoe, Boyz II <kw>men</kw>, <kw>jimmy</kw> Buffett, Carole King, Extreme, Buffalo Springfield, The Monkees, Neil Young, and Jason Aldean. The Israel Trauma Coalition for Response and Preparedness sent six psychologists and specialists from Israel to help <kw>boston</kw> emergency responder, government administrators, and community stakeholders develop post-terrorist <kw>attack</kw> recovery strategies. Following a $212,000 donation from Health Bridge Management on <d>2013</d>, the One <kw>fund</kw> <kw>boston</kw> had received more than $69.8 million in donations. As a safety precaution, the NHL postponed a <kw>boston</kw> Bruins home game against the Ottawa Senators at TD Garden scheduled for <d>2013</d>, to <d>2013</d> instead. The <kw>boston</kw> Symphony Orchestra canceled its performance of <d>2013</d>. On <d>2013</d>, the MBTA <kw>public</kw> transit system, which was partly shut down, was under heavy National Guard and <kw>police</kw> presence and it was shut down a second time <d>2013</d> during the <kw>manhunt</kw>. The NBA\\'s <kw>boston</kw> Celtics game scheduled for <d>2013</d> against the Indiana Pacers was canceled since both teams\\' playoff seedings were already set. The <kw>boston</kw> Red Sox game at Fenway, the Bruins game, and the Big Apple Circus performance scheduled for <d>2013</d>, were postponed to support efforts of <kw>law</kw> <kw>enforcement</kw> officers. The NCAA announced on <d>2013</d> that the <d>2013</d> NCAA Men\\'s Division III Volleyball Championship, scheduled for <d>2013</d>–<d>2013</d> at the MIT campus in Cambridge, would be moved to Nazareth College in the Rochester, New York <kw>area</kw>. In the days after the <kw>bombing</kw>, makeshift memorials began to <d>2013</d> up all along the cordoned off <kw>area</kw> surrounding <kw>boylston</kw> <kw>street</kw>. The largest was initially <kw>located</kw> on Arlington <kw>street</kw>, the easternmost edge of the barricades. Starting with flowers, tokens and T-shirts, the makeshift memorial at Arlington <kw>street</kw> quickly expanded prior to the move of the easternmost edge of the barricade westward from Arlington <kw>street</kw> to Berkeley <kw>street</kw>, as well as the move of the memorial from Arlington <kw>street</kw> to Berkeley <kw>street</kw>. The growth of the memorial at Berkeley <kw>street</kw> was rapid over the proceeding days starting with a small pile of assorted mementos on <d>2013</d>, and growing to a substantial shrine on <d>2013</d>. By <d>2013</d>, the memorial was beginning to swell outwards toward Berkeley <kw>street</kw> itself. With the reopening of <kw>copley</kw> <kw>square</kw> to the <kw>public</kw>, the memorials along the boundaries of <kw>boylston</kw> <kw>street</kw>, including the largest one at Berkeley <kw>street</kw>, were consolidated and moved into <kw>copley</kw> <kw>square</kw>. In <d>2012</d> the Makeshift Memorial <kw>located</kw> in <kw>copley</kw> <kw>square</kw> was taken down and the memorial objects <kw>located</kw> there were moved to the archives in West Roxbury for cleaning, fumigation, and archiving. <kw>boston</kw> <kw>university</kw> established a scholarship in honor of Lü Lingzi, a student who died in the <kw>bombing</kw>. MIT also established a scholarship and erected a sculpture (unveiled on <d>2015</d>), both in memory of MIT <kw>police</kw> officer Sean Collier. On <d>2013</d>, the Celtics honored the <kw>bombing</kw> victims and first responders before their playoff game against the Knicks at home in the TD Garden. The Bruins\\' home playoff games held <kw>tributes</kw> to the <kw>marathon</kw> <kw>bombing</kw> victims and first responders before the opening face-off. After the Chicago Blackhawks defeated the Bruins in the <d>2013</d> Stanley Cup Finals, the Blackhawks took out a full-page ad in the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>globe</kw> thanking the city of <kw>boston</kw> for respect and sportsmanship during the Cup Finals and praising their recovery from the <kw>bombing</kw>. On <d>2012</d>, the New England Patriots honored 25 first responders with special jerseys in a ceremony before their opening home game against the New York Jets at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough. After the Red Sox won the <d>2013</d> World Series, the team used their celebratory parade on <d>2013</d>, to honor the victims of the <kw>bombing</kw> at a dedication on the <kw>marathon</kw> <kw>finish</kw> <kw>line</kw>, a move considered to help the city \"reclaim\" its spirit that was lost after the <kw>bombing</kw>. A couple, Christian Williams and Caroline Reinsch, who both had sustained injuries in the <kw>bombing</kw>, and who had <kw>learned</kw> they were expecting while in <kw>hospital</kw>, had a daughter on <d>2013</d>. President Barack Obama addressed the nation after the <kw>attack</kw>. He said that, although the perpetrator(s) were still unknown, the government would \"get to the bottom of this\" and that those responsible \"will feel the full weight of <kw>justice</kw>\". The President addressed the <kw>american</kw> <kw>people</kw> <d>2013</d>, and later said, \"Any time <kw>bombs</kw> are used to target innocent civilians, it is an act of terror.\" President Obama ordered flags to half-staff until <d>2013</d> on all <kw>federal</kw> buildings as \"a mark of respect for the victims of the senseless acts of violence perpetrated on <d>2013</d>, in <kw>boston</kw>, <kw>massachusetts</kw>.\" On <d>2013</d>, President Obama addressed an interfaith service at the Cathedral of the Holy Cross in <kw>boston</kw> to honor the victims of the <kw>attacks</kw>. Moments of silence were held at various <kw>events</kw> across the country, including at the openings of the New York Stock Exchange, NASDAQ, and NYMEX on the day after the <kw>bombing</kw>. A <kw>boston</kw> Remembrance Run held in Portland, Oregon, on <d>2013</d>, drew over 1,000 <kw>runners</kw> in a silent show of support. The Oklahoma City Memorial <kw>marathon</kw> organizers <kw>asked</kw> <kw>runners</kw>, volunteers, and spectators to wear red socks. <kw>marathon</kw> organizer Andrea Miles said, \"As Oklahomans and folks participating in the OKC Memorial <kw>marathon</kw>, we have such a deep connection to not only the <kw>marathon</kw> but the <kw>events</kw> from the Murrah <kw>bombing</kw> that have led to this memorial,\" Miles said. \"So <d>PRESENT_REF</d> we\\'re not just running to remember the 168 <kw>people</kw> who were lost in <d>1995</d> but also to honor <kw>boston</kw> and stand in solidarity with them.\". The <kw>marathon</kw> in Lansing, MI was the first <kw>marathon</kw> ran in the <kw>united</kw> States after the <kw>bombing</kw>. The <kw>events</kw> featured a moment of silence led by Mayor Virg Benero in respect for those affected by the incidents in <kw>boston</kw>. This was preceded by Benero joining a Michigan resident who, after stopping short of the <kw>finish</kw> in <kw>boston</kw> due to the <kw>bombing</kw>, finished the remaining half-mile of the race in Lansing. On <d>2013</d>, a cross-country relay, One Run for <kw>boston</kw>, <kw>left</kw> Venice Beach, Los Angeles, California, for <kw>boston</kw>. Organized by three Britons—Danny Bent, Kate Treleaven and James Hay—to support the <kw>boston</kw> One <kw>fund</kw>, the relay included more than 2,000 <kw>runners</kw> in 319 stages of 5 to 12 miles for a total of more than 3,000 miles in 14 states. The GPS baton carried to track the relay\\'s progress crossed the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> <kw>finish</kw> <kw>line</kw> <d>2013</d> on <d>2013</d>. The <kw>bombing</kw> was denounced and condolences were offered by many international leaders as well as leading figures from international sport. <kw>security</kw> measures were increased worldwide in the wake of the <kw>attack</kw>. In China, users posted condolence messages on Weibo in response to the death of Lü Lingzi. Chris Buckley of The New York Times said \"Ms. Lu\\'s death gave a melancholy face to the attraction that America and its colleges exert over many young <kw>chinese</kw>.\" Laurie Burkitt of The Wall <kw>street</kw> Journal said \"Ms. Lu\\'s death resonates with many in China\" due to the one-child policy. Organizers of the London <kw>marathon</kw>, which was held <d>P6D</d> after the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>bombing</kw>, reviewed <kw>security</kw> arrangements for their event, despite there not being any threat against it. Hundreds of extra <kw>police</kw> officers were drafted in to provide a greater presence on the streets, but despite the <kw>security</kw> concerns a record 700,000 spectators lined the streets. <kw>runners</kw> in London observed a <d>PT30S</d> silence in respect for the victims of <kw>boston</kw> shortly before the race began, and many <kw>runners</kw> wore black ribbons on their vests. Organisers also pledged to donate US$3 to a <kw>fund</kw> for <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> victims for every person who finished the race. Organizers of the <d>2013</d> Vancouver Sun Run, which was held on <d>2013</d>, donated $10 from every late entry for the race to help victims of the <kw>bombing</kw> at the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw>. Jamie Pitblado, vice-president of promotions for The Vancouver Sun and The Province, said the money would go to One <kw>fund</kw> <kw>boston</kw>, an <kw>official</kw> charity that\\'s collecting donations for the victims and their families. Sun Run organizers raised anywhere from $25,000 to $40,000. There were over 48,000 <kw>participants</kw>, many dressed in blue and yellow (<kw>boston</kw> colors) with others wearing <kw>boston</kw> Red Sox caps. Petr Gandalovic, ambassador of the Czech Republic, released a statement after noticing much confusion on <kw>facebook</kw> and Twitter between his nation and the Chechen Republic. \"The Czech Republic and Chechnya are two very different entities – the Czech Republic is a Central European country; Chechnya is a part of the Russian Federation.\" <kw>security</kw> was also stepped up in Singapore in response to online threats <kw>made</kw> on attacking several locations in the city-state and the Singapore <kw>marathon</kw> in <d>2012</d>. Two <kw>suspects</kw> were investigated and one was eventually arrested for making false bomb threats. The Russian government said special attention would be <kw>paid</kw> to <kw>security</kw> at upcoming international sports <kw>events</kw> in Russia, including the <d>2014</d> <d>2013</d> Olympics. According to the Russian embassy in the U.S., President Vladimir Putin condemned the <kw>bombing</kw> as a \"barbaric <kw>crime</kw>\" and \"stressed that the Russian Federation will be ready, if necessary, to assist in the U.S. authorities\\' <kw>investigation</kw>.\" He urged closer cooperation of <kw>security</kw> services with Western partners. Republican U.S. Senators Saxby Chambliss and Richard Burr <kw>reported</kw> that Russian <kw>authorities</kw> had separately <kw>asked</kw> both the <kw>fbi</kw> (at least twice: during <d>2011</d> and <d>2011</d>) and the CIA (<d>2011</d>) to look carefully into <kw>tamerlan</kw> <kw>tsarnaev</kw> and provide more information about him back to Russia. Russian <kw>federal</kw> <kw>security</kw> Service (FSB) secretly recorded phone conversations between <kw>tamerlan</kw> <kw>tsarnaev</kw> and his mother Zubeidat Tsarnaeva (they vaguely and indirectly discussed jihad) and sent these to the <kw>fbi</kw> as evidence of possible extremist links within the family. However, while Russia offered US intelligence services warnings that <kw>tsarnaev</kw> planned to link up with extremist groups abroad, an <kw>fbi</kw> <kw>investigation</kw> yielded no evidence to support those claims at the time. In addition, subsequent U.S. requests for additional information about <kw>tsarnaev</kw> went unanswered by the Russians. But Russian <kw>authorities</kw> and <kw>mass</kw> <kw>media</kw> blame U.S. <kw>authorities</kw> for negligence because the <kw>authorities</kw> were warned by Russian counterparts several times long before the <kw>bombing</kw> happened. Moreover Russian <kw>authorities</kw> and <kw>mass</kw> <kw>media</kw> since <d>2014</d> blame USA for politically motivated false information about lack of response from Russian <kw>authorities</kw> after subsequent U.S. requests. As a proof a letter from Russian <kw>federal</kw> <kw>security</kw> Service (FSB) were shown to the members of U.S. Congressmen <kw>official</kw> delegation to Moscow during their visit. This letter with information about <kw>tsarnaev</kw> (including his biography details, connections and phone number) had been sent from FSB to <kw>fbi</kw> and CIA during <d>2011</d>. On <d>2013</d>, the press-secretary of the head of the Chechen Republic, Ramzan Kadyrov, issued a statement that, inter alia, read: \"The <kw>boston</kw> <kw>bombing</kw> <kw>suspects</kw> have nothing to do with Chechnya\". On <d>2013</d>, Kadyrov was <kw>reported</kw> by The Guardian to have written on Instagram: Any attempt to make a link between Chechnya and the Tsarnaevs, if they are guilty, is in vain. They grew up in the U.S., their views and beliefs were formed there. The roots of evil must be searched for in America. The whole world must battle with <kw>terrorism</kw>. We know this better than anyone. We wish recover to all the victims and share Americans\\' feeling of sorrow. Akhmed Zakayev, head of the secular wing of the Chechen separatist movement, <d>PRESENT_REF</d> in exile in London, condemned the <kw>bombing</kw> as \"terrorist\" and expressed condolences to the families of the victims. Zakayev denied that the <kw>bombers</kw> were in any way representative of the Chechen <kw>people</kw>, saying that \"the Chechen <kw>people</kw> never had and can not have any hostile feelings toward the <kw>united</kw> States and its citizens.\" The Mujahideen of the Caucasus Emirate Province of Dagestan, the Caucasian Islamist organization in both Chechnya and Dagestan, denied any link to the <kw>bombing</kw> or the <kw>tsarnaev</kw> brothers and stated that it was at war with Russia, not the <kw>united</kw> States. It also said that it had sworn off violence against civilians since <d>2012</d>. In the Turkistan Islamic Party\\'s Turkestan Al-Islamiyya magazine, Issue 13, the Rohingya cleric Abu Dhar \\'Azzam (Abu Dhar Al-Burmi) congratulated the <kw>tsarnaev</kw> brothers on their terrorist <kw>attack</kw> in the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> <kw>bombing</kw>, saying In the very house of unbelief, two Chechen brothers destroyed the infidels\\' fortresses on <d>2013</d>. During the [ensuing] search [by the <kw>authorities</kw> for the perpetrators], the elder brother died as a martyr in the field of glory and honor, Allah willing. The younger brother, Dzokhar, remained, and <kw>told</kw> his dear nation: \\'We did this operation as revenge for what America does in Palestine, Iraq, and Afghanistan.\\' He didn\\'t mention his homeland Chechnya, since this jihad is a jihad of [an entire] nation, not [a campaign] for the liberation of a single land.... The Muslims\\' lands are one and their honor is one. During the <kw>manhunt</kw> for the perpetrators of the <kw>bombing</kw>, Governor Deval Patrick said \"we are asking <kw>people</kw> to shelter in place.\" The request was highly effective; most <kw>people</kw> stayed home, causing <kw>boston</kw>, Watertown, and Cambridge to come to a virtual standstill. According to Time magazine, \"<kw>media</kw> described residents complying with a \\'lockdown order,\\' but in reality the governor\\'s <kw>security</kw> measure was a request. Scott Silliman, emeritus director of the Center on <kw>law</kw>, Ethics and National <kw>security</kw> at Duke <kw>law</kw> School, said that the shelter-in-place request was voluntary. The shelter-in-place directive was criticized by some commentators. Michael Cohen of The Observer said that <kw>americans</kw> have little experience with daily <kw>terrorism</kw> compared to some countries and \"are more primed to … assume the absolute worst.\" Cohen wrote that it was not the first time dangerous murderers have been on the loose in a large <kw>american</kw> city (citing Christopher Dorner in <d>2013</d> and the Beltway sniper <kw>attacks</kw> in <d>2002</d>), but noted that \"lockdown\" measures were not used in those cases. Former congressman and presidential candidate Ron Paul, criticized what he described as a \"military-style takeover of parts of <kw>boston</kw>\" during the <kw>investigation</kw> and wrote that \"this unprecedented move should frighten us as much or more than the <kw>attack</kw> itself.\" Haaretz\\'s Chemi Salev wrote that \"in terms of cost-benefit analysis, from the evil terrorist\\'s point of view, the <kw>boylston</kw> <kw>street</kw> <kw>bombings</kw> and their aftermath can only be viewed as a resounding triumph\" since the \"relatively amateurish\" terrorists managed to intimidate a vast number of <kw>people</kw> and got a maximum amount of publicity. Responding to Salev in the New York Times, Ross Douthat commented that the massive <kw>manhunt</kw> operation might deter other amateur terrorists, but not hard-core terrorists such as Mohammed Atta. Douthat argued that out-of-the-ordinary measures can only be used when <kw>terrorism</kw> itself is out-of-the-ordinary: if <kw>attacks</kw> started to occur more often, <kw>people</kw> would not be as willing to comply with shelter-in-place commands, yet once a terrorist has been hunted with such an operation, it is hard to justify why such measures should not be taken the next time. On the afternoon of the <kw>bombing</kw>, The New York Post <kw>reported</kw> that a <kw>suspect</kw>, a Saudi Arabian male, was under guard and being questioned at a <kw>boston</kw> <kw>hospital</kw>. That evening, <kw>boston</kw> <kw>police</kw> Commissioner Ed <kw>davis</kw> said that there had not been an arrest. The Post did not retract its story about the <kw>suspect</kw>, leading to widespread <kw>reports</kw> by CBS News, <kw>cnn</kw>, and other <kw>media</kw> that a Middle Eastern <kw>suspect</kw> was in custody. The day after the <kw>bombing</kw>, a <kw>majority</kw> of outlets were reporting that the Saudi was a witness, not a <kw>suspect</kw>. The New York Post on its <d>2013</d> front page showed two <kw>men</kw>, and said they were being sought by the <kw>authorities</kw>. The two were not the ones being sought as <kw>suspects</kw>. They were a 17-year-old <kw>boy</kw> and his track coach.

Hospitals <kw>reported</kw> at least 144 <kw>people</kw> are being treated, with at least 17 of them in critical condition and 25 in serious condition. At least eight of the patients are children. Several of the patients treated at <kw>massachusetts</kw> General <kw>hospital</kw> suffered injuries to lower limbs that will require \"serial operations\" in the <d>FUTURE_REF</d>, trauma surgeon Peter Fagenholz said <d>2013</d>. Some injuries were so severe amputations were necessary, Fagenholz added. <kw>boston</kw> \"is a tough and resilient town,\" he said, adding that <kw>americans</kw> will stand by Bostonians \"every single step of the way.\" The terrorist <kw>attack</kw>, near the marathon\\'s <kw>finish</kw> <kw>line</kw>, triggered widespread screaming and chaos, shattered windows and barricades and sent smoke billowing into the air at <kw>copley</kw> <kw>square</kw>. The <kw>blasts</kw> were about 50 to 100 <kw>yards</kw> apart, <kw>officials</kw> said, on a stretch of the <kw>marathon</kw> course lined with spectators cheering <kw>runners</kw> through the final <kw>yards</kw> of a 26-mile, 385-yard endurance feat. Allan Panter, a doctor who was near the <kw>finish</kw> <kw>line</kw> waiting for his wife to <kw>finish</kw> the race, <kw>told</kw> <kw>cnn</kw> he was standing about 20 to 25 feet from the first blast. He said he treated victims on the <kw>street</kw> after the <kw>explosion</kw>. \"I saw at least six to seven <kw>people</kw> down next to me,\" he said. \"They protected me from the blast. One lady expired. One gentleman lost both his (lower) limbs. Most of the injuries were lower extremities.\" Bill Iffrig, 78 and a veteran marathoner, was nearing the <kw>finish</kw> when \"the shock waves just hit my whole body and my legs just started jittering around.\" Iffrig, who can be seen in <kw>video</kw> of the <kw>explosion</kw> wearing an orange tank top, was helped to his feet by an event volunteer and had just a scratch from his fall, he <kw>told</kw> <kw>cnn</kw>. <kw>federal</kw> <kw>authorities</kw> are classifying the <kw>bombings</kw> as a terrorist <kw>attack</kw>, but it\\'s not clear whether the origin was domestic or foreign, a <kw>federal</kw> <kw>law</kw> <kw>enforcement</kw> <kw>official</kw> with knowledge of the <kw>investigation</kw> said. A <kw>federal</kw> <kw>law</kw> <kw>enforcement</kw> <kw>official</kw> <kw>told</kw> <kw>cnn</kw> that both <kw>bombs</kw> were small, and initial tests showed no C-4 or other high-grade explosive material, suggesting that the <kw>packages</kw> used in the <kw>attack</kw> were crude explosive <kw>devices</kw>. One unexploded device was <kw>found</kw> at a hotel on <kw>boylston</kw> <kw>street</kw> near the bomb site and another unexploded device was <kw>found</kw> at an undisclosed location, Keating, a Democrat and member of the House Homeland <kw>security</kw> Committee, said. He called the <kw>bombing</kw> a \"sophisticated, coordinated, planned <kw>attack</kw>.\" It was unclear who may have planted the <kw>marathon</kw> <kw>bombs</kw>. There were no credible threats before the race, a state government <kw>official</kw> said. Investigators warned <kw>police</kw> to be on the lookout for a \"darker-skinned or black male\" with a possible foreign accent in connection with the <kw>attack</kw>, according to a <kw>law</kw> <kw>enforcement</kw> advisory obtained by <kw>cnn</kw>. The <kw>man</kw> was seen with a black backpack and sweatshirt and was trying to get into a restricted <kw>area</kw> <d>PT5M</d> before the first <kw>explosion</kw>, the lookout notice states. Also, a Saudi national with a leg wound was under guard at a <kw>boston</kw> <kw>hospital</kw> in connection with the <kw>bombings</kw>, but investigators cannot say he is involved at this time and he is not in custody, a <kw>law</kw> <kw>enforcement</kw> <kw>official</kw> said <d>2013</d>. In addition to scrutinizing images of surveillance cameras in the <kw>area</kw>, the <kw>fbi</kw> likely was issuing subpoenas for records from cell towers in the <kw>area</kw> to isolate and trace calls from around <kw>copley</kw> <kw>square</kw> at the time of the <kw>blasts</kw>, according to a former <kw>federal</kw> <kw>law</kw> <kw>enforcement</kw> <kw>official</kw> who <d>PRESENT_REF</d> works in the intelligence community. The unexploded <kw>devices</kw> that were recovered could provide a treasure trove of information such as fingerprints and indications of the bomb maker\\'s design, and from the <kw>bombs</kw> that did explode, investigators would be looking for fragments and anything indicating the \"signature\" of the bomb makers, the <kw>official</kw> <kw>told</kw> <kw>cnn</kw>. As <kw>authorities</kw> searched the <kw>scene</kw>, numerous <kw>suspicious</kw> <kw>packages</kw> were <kw>found</kw>, possibly because <kw>people</kw> fled the <kw>area</kw>, leaving <kw>items</kw> behind.

       " 6: 'Claim: Rumors and conspiracy theories associated with the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> <kw>bombing</kw>. Origins: As is <kw>common</kw> after disasters in the Internet age (e.g., the 9/11 <kw>attacks</kw>, Hurricane Katrina, the Sandy <kw>hook</kw> shooting), the online word is abuzz with a variety of rumors and conspiracy theories related to that event. Below we attempt to chart some of the most prevalent <kw>items</kw> associated with the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> <kw>bombings</kw> of <d>2013</d>: <kw>fbi</kw> Previous <kw>investigation</kw> of <kw>tamerlan</kw> <kw>tsarnaev</kw> On <d>2013</d>, the <kw>fbi</kw> confirmed that it had previously investigated the background of <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> <kw>bombing</kw> <kw>suspect</kw> <kw>tamerlan</kw> <kw>tsarnaev</kw>, stating in a <kw>press</kw> release that: The two individuals believed to be responsible for the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> <kw>bombings</kw> have been positively <kw>identified</kw> as <kw>tamerlan</kw> <kw>tsarnaev</kw>, <d>PRESENT_REF</d> deceased, and Dzhokar <kw>tsarnaev</kw>, <d>PRESENT_REF</d> in custody. These individuals are brothers and residents of <kw>massachusetts</kw>. <kw>tamerlan</kw> <kw>tsarnaev</kw> was a legal permanent resident and Dzhokar <kw>tsarnaev</kw> is a naturalized U.S. citizen. Once the <kw>fbi</kw> <kw>learned</kw> the identities of the two brothers, the <kw>fbi</kw> reviewed its records and determined that in <d>2011</d>, a foreign government <kw>asked</kw> the <kw>fbi</kw> for information about <kw>tamerlan</kw> <kw>tsarnaev</kw>. The request stated that it was based on information that he was a follower of <kw>radical</kw> <kw>islam</kw> and a strong believer, and that he had changed drastically since <d>2010</d> as he prepared to leave the <kw>united</kw> States for travel to the country\\'s region to join unspecified underground groups. In response to this <d>2011</d> request, the <kw>fbi</kw> checked U.S. government databases and other information to look for such things as derogatory telephone communications, possible use of online <kw>sites</kw> associated with the promotion of <kw>radical</kw> activity, associations with other persons of interest, travel <kw>history</kw> and plans, and education <kw>history</kw>. The <kw>fbi</kw> also interviewed <kw>tamerlan</kw> <kw>tsarnaev</kw> and family members. The <kw>fbi</kw> did not find any <kw>terrorism</kw> activity, domestic or foreign, and those results were provided to the foreign government in <d>2011</d>. The <kw>fbi</kw> requested but did not receive more specific or additional information from the foreign government. <kw>suspects</kw> Became Citizens on 9/11 One rumor posited the irony that the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> <kw>bombing</kw> <kw>suspects</kw>, brothers <kw>tamerlan</kw> and Dzhokar <kw>tsarnaev</kw> (originally from the Russian republic of Kyrgyzstan or Chechnya) had become naturalized citizens of the U.S. on <d>2012</d>, the anniversary of the 2001 terrorist <kw>attacks</kw> on the World Trade Center and Pentagon. According to news accounts, Dzhokar came to America on <d>2002</d> as a tourist, <kw>asked</kw> for asylum, and was naturalized as a U.S. citizen on <d>2012</d>. However, his older brother <kw>tamerlan</kw> came to the U.S. later; although <kw>tamerlan</kw> eventually acquired permanent residency status, he did not obtain U.S. citizenship. \\'Coexist\\' Bumper Sticker Over <d>2013</d>-<d>2013</d>, the two <kw>suspects</kw> in the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> <kw>bombings</kw>, <kw>tamerlan</kw> and Dzhokar <kw>tsarnaev</kw>, reportedly fatally shot an MIT <kw>police</kw> officer in Cambridge, carjacked a Mercedes SUV, led <kw>police</kw> on a car chase into Watertown, and engaged in a firefight that <kw>ended</kw> with <kw>tamerlan</kw> being shot dead. His younger brother Dzhokar eventually abandoned the stolen vehicle and fled on foot; he was captured that evening after being discovered hiding in a boat parked behind a house. Rumor later claimed that the vehicle the <kw>tsarnaev</kw> brothers carjacked bore a \\'Coexist\\' bumper sticker, a claim based on the following screen capture from a television news report: However, the vehicle shown in that image does not appear to match the Mercedes SUV that other news accounts described and pictured as the one carjacked by the <kw>tsarnaev</kw> brothers: Pressure Cooker Ad On <d>2013</d>, both the print and <kw>digital</kw> versions of the Minneapolis Star Tribune inadvertently ran a Macy\\'s advertisement for pressure cookers adjacent to a story about citizens helping victims wounded in the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> <kw>bombings</kw>, something of a faux pas because it is believed that the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>bombings</kw> were carried out using pressure cookers packed with explosives: Westboro Baptist Church The Westboro Baptist Church (WBC), of Topeka, Kansas, is headed by pastor Fred Phelps. WBC is widely known for its anti-homosexual stance, and members of its congregation have drawn much publicity by staging anti-gay protests and picketing at the funerals of military members and celebrities. (At such funerals, WBC members typically portray the deceased\\'s passing as God\\'s punishment for America\\'s tolerance of homosexuality.) As they did after the Sandy <kw>hook</kw> shootings, the WBC has announced an intention to picket the funerals of those killed in the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> <kw>bombings</kw> in the sense that they stated so in a Twitter announcement on the afternoon of the <kw>bombings</kw>: However, although the Westboro Baptist Church had said they planned to picket the funeral of Sandy <kw>hook</kw> principal Dawn Hochsprung, motorcyclists lined up at the site of the service that day to confront the WBC\\'s protesters, and the latter never did materialize. Supporters of the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> victims are hoping the WBC will be no-shows at the funerals of those killed in that tragedy as well. Suspect/Backpack <kw>photos</kw> A pair of circulated photographs purportedly show a black backpack from the <kw>scene</kw> of the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> <kw>bombings</kw> and a <kw>man</kw> in the crowd at the <kw>marathon</kw> (who is said to be wanted by <kw>police</kw>) wearing a blue jacket and carrying what looks like that backpack: According to news accounts, the former picture was included in a <kw>security</kw> bulletin issued to <kw>law</kw> <kw>enforcement</kw> agencies by the <kw>fbi</kw> and shows a shredded backpack in which one of the <kw>bombs</kw> was hidden. The latter picture was not one that was distributed by <kw>police</kw> for help in locating a <kw>suspect</kw>; rather, it is the product of various individuals on the Internet scouring <kw>photos</kw> of the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> <kw>scene</kw> for clues and circulating their speculations online. . On <d>2013</d>, <d>2013</d>, the <kw>fbi</kw> released photographs of two <kw>suspects</kw> they were seeking additional information about, neither of whom was the <kw>man</kw> pictured above: On <d>2013</d>, one of the <kw>suspects</kw> was killed in a shootout with <kw>police</kw>, and the second was apprehended later <d>2013</d> in Watertown, <kw>massachusetts</kw>. \"Early Creation\" <kw>facebook</kw> Pages As occurred after the Sandy <kw>hook</kw> shooting, conspiracy proponents claimed that a number of the <kw>facebook</kw> <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> bombing-related pages of the type which inevitably <d>2013</d> up in the aftermath of such tragedies (e.g., memorials, <kw>tributes</kw>, condolences, and donation <kw>sites</kw> for victims) bear dates indicating they were created earlier than the occurrence of the <kw>events</kw> they reference, thus exposing those tragedies as \"false flag\" <kw>events</kw> planned and coordinated by some sinister force (usually said to be the government) intent on deflecting blame away from the \"real\" perpetrators. After the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> <kw>bombing</kw>, one page titled \"Our thoughts and prayers go out to all involved in the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>bombings</kw>\" was flagged as such because it was allegedly created <d>PTXH</d> prior to the <kw>bombings</kw>, and another (since removed) page with the title \"Thoughts go out to all involved in the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>explosions</kw>\" was similarly <kw>identified</kw> as <kw>suspicious</kw> because it bore a \"Joined <kw>facebook</kw>\" date of <d>2013</d> (<d>P2D</d> before the <kw>bombings</kw> it references). However, as we discuss in another article, the dates shown on <kw>facebook</kw> pages are not reliable indicators of their dates of creation. The date indicating when the entity associated with the page was Born, Founded, Started, Created, Opened, or Launched is a user-selectable value that can be set to anything the page creator wishes to choose. (Hence our own snopes.com <kw>facebook</kw> page bears the legend \"Launched in <d>1994</d>,\" because that\\'s when we first began publishing material about urban legends on the web.) Likewise, \"Joined <kw>facebook</kw>\" dates by themselves do not provide reliable timelines documenting the creation dates of <kw>facebook</kw> pages. <kw>facebook</kw> page names can be changed, and pages which were initially created prior to particular <kw>events</kw> for other reasons and then renamed/repurposed after those <kw>events</kw> retain their original pre-tragedy dates. So, an unused <kw>facebook</kw> page created in <d>2013</d> can be quickly renamed to serve as a memorial for victims who died in an <d>2013</d> <kw>bombing</kw>, but the \"Joined <kw>facebook</kw>\" date will reflect the earlier (<d>2013</d>) date. Sandy <kw>hook</kw> Child Killed in <kw>bombing</kw> One prominent rumor claimed that one of the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> <kw>bombing</kw> victims was an 8-year-old girl who attended school at Sandy <kw>hook</kw> and/or was running the <kw>marathon</kw> for the victims of the Sandy <kw>hook</kw> shootings. Some iterations of the rumor included a photograph of the purported victim: This rumor is false: the child killed in the <kw>bombings</kw> was not a participant in the race, and children are not allowed on the course. As <kw>reported</kw> in the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>globe</kw>, the young victim was Martin Richard, an 8-year-old <kw>boy</kw> who was killed as he waited near the <kw>finish</kw> <kw>line</kw> with his parents and siblings: Grief-stricken neighbors <d>2013</d> described Martin Richard, the 8-year-old Dorchester <kw>boy</kw> killed when two <kw>bombs</kw> detonated at the <kw>finish</kw> <kw>line</kw> of the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> , as a child full of life who was part of a very close-knit family. “They were always together,\" neighbor Jane Sherman said of the Richard family, who live next door to her on Carruth <kw>street</kw> in Dorchester. \"This is the worst tragedy I have ever been through in my life. It’s a horrific situation.\" The <kw>boy</kw> was killed and his mother and his younger sister gravely wounded as they waited at the <kw>boylston</kw> <kw>street</kw> <kw>finish</kw> <kw>line</kw>. The picture of the girl is completely unrelated to the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> <kw>bombings</kw>; it\\'s a photograph taken from another race (the 3rd Annual Joe Cassella 5K) run in Virginia back in <d>2012</d>. Martin Richard Photo After Martin Richard was <kw>identified</kw> as the 8-year-old child who had been killed by one of the <kw>explosions</kw>, a photograph was circulated showing a <kw>boy</kw> holding up a sign decorated with hearts and a peace sign and bearing the legend \"No more hurting <kw>people</kw>. Peace.\" This photo was said to be a picture of Martin Richard: This is Martin, 8. He died in the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>bombing</kw> <d>2013</d>. He was at the <kw>finish</kw> <kw>line</kw> with his family, waiting for his dad to cross. His mother and little sister were catastrophically injured. He was the student of our dear <kw>friend</kw>, Rachel Moo. His message resonates powerfully <d>2013</d>. My prayer is that we all live by Martin\\'s words, paying tribute to his too-brief, but immeasurably valuable life by following his example. This is indeed a picture of Martin Richard, taken in <d>2012</d> during a classroom lesson on the shooting of Trayvon Martin. A photo gallery published by the New York Post includes this image along with other photographs of Martin Richard and <kw>pictures</kw> of well-wishers visiting the Richard\\'s home to leave messages, flowers, and other tokens of support. Woman Killed Before Boyfriend\\'s Proposal One circulated photograph reportedly showed a <kw>man</kw> in a posture of anguish after learning that his girlfriend, whom he planned to propose to after she completed running the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw>, had been killed in the <kw>bombings</kw>: The <kw>man</kw> in the red shirt planned to propose to his girlfriend as she crossed the <kw>finish</kw> <kw>line</kw> at the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw>, but she passed away. Most of us will never experience this amount of emotional pain. Occurrences like this remind us how fragile life is and how important each person is to so many <kw>people</kw>. My heart goes out to all of the <kw>people</kw> affected. According to news accounts, this photograph shows a <kw>man</kw> attempting to render aid to Sydney Corcoran, an 18-year-old high school student whose legs were shredded by shrapnel from one of the <kw>bombs</kw>. The so far unidentified <kw>man</kw> in the red shirt has been described as a \"stranger\" and not her boyfriend, and Sydney Corcoran was not a participant in the race (nor was she killed by the <kw>explosion</kw> that injured her): Shrapnel from one of the <kw>bombs</kw> that exploded during the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> shredded both of Sydney\\'s legs, leaving her with deep arterial injuries, said her older brother, Tyler Corcoran, during an interview in the kitchen of the family\\'s home in the city\\'s Pawtucketville neighborhood. Sydney, with her mother, Celeste, and father Kevin, were in <kw>boston</kw> to watch her aunt, Carmen Accabo, of Westford, <kw>finish</kw> the storied event. Celeste, too, was struck by shrapnel and overnight had both legs amputated below the knee, Tyler said. Kevin received minor injuries, but otherwise was physically okay. He was at the <kw>boston</kw> Medical Center bedsides of both his wife and daughter <d>2013</d>, said his brother, Tim Corcoran, of Rhode Island. The picture [of her being aided by a stranger] in a red t-shirt was so touching that it sparked a false rumor on Twitter that he was proposing to his dying girlfriend. <kw>boston</kw> <kw>globe</kw> Tweet On <d>2013</d>, the Twitter feed of the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>globe</kw> <kw>reported</kw> that <kw>officials</kw> had stated \"There will be a controlled <kw>explosion</kw> opposite the library within <d>PT1M</d> as part of bomb squad activities\": This tweet was proffered by conspiracy theorists as proof that <kw>officials</kw> planned for a \"controlled <kw>explosion</kw>\" to be under way at the same time as the <kw>marathon</kw> <kw>explosions</kw>, a highly <kw>suspect</kw> \"coincidence\" that indicated the <kw>bombings</kw> were \"false flag\" operation. However, this tweet was issued <d>PT1H</d> after the bomb <kw>blasts</kw> and referenced a controlled detonation of a <kw>suspicious</kw> device near the central branch of the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>public</kw> Library, which is on the stretch of <kw>boylston</kw> <kw>street</kw> where the initial <kw>explosions</kw> occurred. A fire coincidentally broke out at the JFK Presidential Library and Museum at about the same time as the <kw>explosions</kw>, and as a precaution <kw>police</kw> were summoned to the <kw>scene</kw> while bomb squads swept the building for explosive <kw>devices</kw>: A fire and possible <kw>explosion</kw> <d>2013</d> at the JFK Presidential Library and Museum prompted a full-scale <kw>investigation</kw> by local, state, and <kw>federal</kw> <kw>authorities</kw> to determine whether the incidents were linked to the deadly <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> <kw>blasts</kw>. The fire broke out shortly before <d>2013</d> — around the same time as the <kw>marathon</kw> <kw>explosions</kw> several miles away — in an HVAC system in a section of the complex opened in <d>2011</d> that houses offices, a classroom, and some archival material, said Rachel Flor, a library spokeswoman. Everyone <kw>evacuated</kw> the building in Dorchester safely and no injuries were <kw>reported</kw>, she said. Thomas Putnam, the library’s director, <kw>told</kw> reporters <d>2013</d> that a bomb squad was coming in as a precautionary measure in light of the <kw>marathon</kw> <kw>blasts</kw>. Shortly afterward, <kw>boston</kw> <kw>police</kw> and State <kw>police</kw> cars swarmed the library parking lot, along with <kw>authorities</kw> from the US Secret Service and the <kw>federal</kw> Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. They ordered all employees and visitors off the property, as they conducted a full sweep for <kw>bombs</kw>. False Victim As happened with the Sandy <kw>hook</kw> shooting, conspiracy buffs have circulated images claiming that persons associated with the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> <kw>bombing</kw> are not who they claim to be, but rather \"actors\" or \"plants\" employed to pull off a staged event. One such image stated that a news photograph showing a <kw>bombing</kw> victim who suffered a serious leg injury in one of the <kw>explosions</kw> actually pictured Nick Vogt, a U.S. Army lieutenant who lost both his legs to an IED <kw>explosion</kw> in Afghanistan in <d>2011</d>: However, the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> <kw>bombing</kw> victim pictured in the upper left-hand quadrant of this image was <kw>identified</kw> on <kw>facebook</kw> as Jeff Bauman Jr., of Chelmsford, <kw>massachusetts</kw>, by his father, Jeff Bauman Sr.: \"Can everyone pray for my son Jeff Jr.?\" Jeff Bauman Sr. wrote in an emotional plea on his <kw>facebook</kw> page hours after the <kw>bombings</kw> at the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw>. The elder Bauman, of Chelmsford, posted that message under a news photo of his critically injured son being rushed from the <kw>scene</kw>, after two <kw>explosions</kw> near the <kw>finish</kw> <kw>line</kw> killed three and injured more than 140. Bauman, who could not be reached for comment, wrote that his son was at the <kw>finish</kw> <kw>line</kw> when he was injured by one of the <kw>blasts</kw>. His son was transported to a <kw>hospital</kw> where he was undergoing surgery on his legs. \"I just can\\'t explain what\\'s wrong with <kw>people</kw> <d>2013</d> to do this to <kw>people</kw>,\" Bauman posted. \"I\\'m really starting to lose faith in our country.\" From his <kw>hospital</kw> <kw>room</kw>, Jeff Bauman Jr. provided the <kw>fbi</kw> with a description of a <kw>man</kw> whom he saw drop a bag near the <kw>finish</kw> <kw>line</kw> of the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw>, information which may have helped <kw>law</kw> <kw>enforcement</kw> identify one of the <kw>suspects</kw>. Sandy <kw>hook</kw> Principal Another image purportedly demonstrated a connection between the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> <kw>bombing</kw> and the Sandy <kw>hook</kw> shooting: Whoa! Government is slipping up! This lady supposedly died in the elementary school shooting & apparently died again in the <kw>bombing</kw> at <kw>boston</kw>. They have to be smarter than this, right? The woman pictured above is the late Dawn Lafferty Hochsprung, the school principal who was killed in the Sandy <kw>hook</kw> shootings, and the right-hand panel purportedly shows her picture being displayed on the screen during an interview with someone named Donna about the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> <kw>bombings</kw>. Some commentators have noted that the woman who stepped in as principal at Sandy <kw>hook</kw> after Dawn Hochsprung\\'s death was Donna Page and theorized that the former was the \"Donna\" referenced during the pictured interview about the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> <kw>bombings</kw> (in the course of which her predecessor\\'s picture was shown on-screen). Although at least one woman named Donna who ran in the <kw>marathon</kw> that day did give <kw>media</kw> interviews about her experience, the only such reference we have seen that mentioned a surname <kw>identified</kw> the interviewee as Donna Bruce, not Donna Page. A group of Newtown parents known as Team Newtown Strong entered the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> and ran the 26 miles to honor the 26 victims of the Sandy <kw>hook</kw> shootings, so it\\'s possible Dawn Hochsprung would have been mentioned if one or more of those team members had been interviewed. <kw>man</kw> on the Roof Another widely circulated image was snapped by college student Dan Lampariello, who was taking <kw>pictures</kw> along the race sidelines and coincidentally happened to capture the moment when one of the <kw>bombs</kw> exploded. The picture he took became a subject of great interest online because it showed a <kw>figure</kw> striding across the roof of a high-rise building block just as the <kw>explosion</kw> occurred on the <kw>street</kw> below, causing many to speculate (without foundation) that the person pictured in the photo had some connection to the <kw>bombings</kw>: No evidence yet suggests there is any reason to connect the person atop a nearby building with either of the <kw>explosions</kw>, as there are plenty of innocuous reasons why someone might have been in that location at the time. Saudi <kw>man</kw> Various news accounts <kw>reported</kw> that 20-year-old Saudi national named Abdul Rahman Ali Al-harbi who was injured in one of the <kw>explosions</kw> was being investigated as a \"person of interest\" by <kw>law</kw> <kw>enforcement</kw> <kw>authorities</kw> to ascertain whether he might have had any connection to the <kw>bombings</kw>: <kw>police</kw> took a 20-year-old Saudi national into custody near the <kw>scene</kw> of the horrific <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> bomb <kw>attack</kw>, law-enforcement sources said. The potential <kw>suspect</kw> was questioned by the <kw>fbi</kw> and local <kw>police</kw> at Boston\\'s Brigham and Women’s <kw>hospital</kw>, where he was under heavy guard while being treated for shrapnel injuries to his leg sustained in the blast. In late afternoon, a large group of <kw>federal</kw> and state <kw>law</kw> <kw>enforcement</kw> <kw>agents</kw> raided an apartment in a building in the Saudi man’s hometown of Revere, <kw>mass</kw>. <kw>fbi</kw> <kw>agents</kw> could be seen through one window. It was not clear what, if anything, they <kw>found</kw>. But Revere fire <kw>officials</kw> said they were called out to support bomb-squad officers as part of an <kw>investigation</kw> of a \"person of interest\" in the <kw>marathon</kw> <kw>attack</kw>. At the <kw>hospital</kw>, investigators seized the man\\'s clothes to examine whether they held any evidence that he was behind the <kw>attack</kw>. The law-enforcement sources also said that the <kw>man</kw> was not free to leave the medical center. Later news accounts <kw>reported</kw> that the young <kw>man</kw> was considered a witness, not a <kw>suspect</kw>: He didn\\'t do it. The Saudi national questioned in the aftermath of the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> terror <kw>blasts</kw> that killed three is considered a witness rather than a <kw>suspect</kw>, sources said. Abdul Rahman Ali <kw>alharbi</kw>, 22, remained hospitalized in <kw>boston</kw> as investigators searched every inch of his Revere, <kw>mass</kw>., apartment and grilled his roommate. But it turns out the student was apparently in the wrong place at the wrong time when two <kw>bombs</kw> exploded near the <kw>finish</kw> <kw>line</kw> of the event that draws <kw>runners</kw> from around the <kw>globe</kw>. Alharbi\\'s <kw>facebook</kw> page indicated that he was in the <kw>united</kw> States on a scholarship to study at the New England School of English. He reportedly held a student visa. A school classmate echoed Bada, describing <kw>alharbi</kw> as a low-key guy who never showed any inkling of anti-American sentiment. \"He is a geek,\" said pal Abdullah Alkayid, 19. \"He likes to study a lot. ... He\\'s a quiet person, doesn\\'t like to go out a lot.\" <d>PXD</d> after the <kw>bombings</kw>, a rumor began to circulate that the U.S. would be deporting <kw>alharbi</kw> back to Saudi Arabia <d>2013</d> on \"<kw>security</kw> and related grounds.\" Since then contradictory <kw>reports</kw> have claimed that he is being deported, that he is not being deported, and that the U.S. government was planning to deport him but is <d>PRESENT_REF</d> reconsidering the move (or has decided against it). <kw>suspect</kw> Caught on CCTV The \"Help Catch the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> Bomber\" <kw>facebook</kw> page posted a picture of a <kw>man</kw> who was supposedly captured on a CCTV <kw>security</kw> camera outside a chemical distribution warehouse in the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>area</kw>: This picture was taken from CCTV surveillance footage outside a chemical distributor storage warehouse (<kw>located</kw> 15 miles away from the place of <kw>explosion</kw> — closest chemical warehouse near the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw>). According to the employees who are employed in the warehouse, the <kw>man</kw> had <kw>asked</kw> for a chemical present in a pentane-air mixture. This type of chemical could be bonded with other chemicals such as the nitric oxide gas, which could cause a massive combustion. Although he was denied the purchase of the chemical (alternative methods of creating explosives are available), there is a high chance that he is responsible or knows something about the <kw>bombings</kw>. If everyone could please like or share this picture and page, we may be able to find out the responsible <kw>people</kw> behind this wicked <kw>crime</kw>. This picture has absolutely nothing to do with the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> <kw>bombings</kw>. It originated with CCTV footage taken back in <d>2011</d> and shows one of three <kw>men</kw> who were observed leaving a building where a burglary took place in Oakham, the county town of Rutland, East Midlands, England. \\'Family Guy\\' Hoax A clip posted on the Internet purported to show a segment from <d>2013</d> episode of the animated Family Guy television series depicting the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> <kw>bombings</kw>: This clip was another hoax accomplished through <kw>digital</kw> manipulation: One of the more tasteless hoaxes making the rounds in the wake of the <kw>bombing</kw> at the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> revolves around a <d>PAST_REF</d> episode of Fox\\'s Family Guy. \"Turban Cowboy,\" which premiered in the U.S. on <d>2013</d>, culminates with a <kw>scene</kw> depicting Peter Griffin accidentally blowing up a bridge by dialing a terrorist\\'s cell phone. But in the <kw>video</kw> making the rounds online, the cell phone <kw>scene</kw> is placed immediately after an unrelated moment in the episode when Bob Costas, voicing himself, asks Peter how he won the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw>. Aside from the confusion prompted in <kw>people</kw> unaware that the clip is a hoax, it\\'s drawn criticism from those involved with the show. \"The edited Family Guy clip <d>PRESENT_REF</d> circulating is abhorrent. The event was a <kw>crime</kw> and a tragedy, and my thoughts are with the victims,\" show creator Seth Macfarlane tweeted. Last updated: <d>2015</d> Allen, Evan and John R.

       " 11: 'A 29-year-old woman, remembered by her mother for her \"heart of gold.\" A <kw>boston</kw> <kw>university</kw> graduate student from China who\\'d gone to enjoy the marathon\\'s <kw>finish</kw> with two classmates. An 8-year-old <kw>boy</kw>, cheering on <kw>runners</kw> with his family. Their lives were snuffed out by twin <kw>blasts</kw> at the tail end of <d>2013</d>\\'s <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw>. Thirteen others -- out of 183 hospitalized -- had limbs amputated, according to <kw>hospital</kw> <kw>officials</kw>. The question is: Why? <d>2013</d>, <kw>authorities</kw> don\\'t have an answer. Unlike after the <d>2001</d>, <kw>attacks</kw>, no one claimed responsibility for this terrorist <kw>attack</kw>. No one had been <kw>identified</kw> as a <kw>suspect</kw>. The <kw>attack</kw> came out of nowhere, with no threat. Just horror. As Richard DesLauriers, the special agent in charge of the FBI\\'s <kw>boston</kw> office, put it <d>2013</d>: \"The range of <kw>suspects</kw> and motives remains wide open.\" The two identical pressure-cooker <kw>bombs</kw> -- each with the capacity to hold six liters of liquid, according to a <kw>boston</kw> <kw>law</kw> <kw>enforcement</kw> source -- blew up seconds and a short distance apart on Boston\\'s <kw>boylston</kw> <kw>street</kw>. They contained BB-like pellets and nails, the FBI\\'s DesLauriers said, causing even more damage. <kw>photos</kw> obtained by <kw>cnn</kw>, which were in a bulletin sent to <kw>federal</kw> <kw>law</kw> <kw>enforcement</kw> agencies, showed parts of a pressure cooker, a shredded black backpack and what appear to be metal pellets or ball bearings. Such evidence -- including a partial circuit board -- are headed to an <kw>fbi</kw> facility in Quantico, Virginia, where <kw>authorities</kw> will try to determine how the <kw>devices</kw> worked and cull out clues identifying the person or persons responsible. Whatever investigators find, whenever they find it, it won\\'t take away the pain. Scores who are not grieving loved ones are faced with a lengthy physical recovery. There\\'s the psychological battle as well -- living with the memories of the deafening <kw>blasts</kw>, the carnage, the fear as they searched for loved ones. Ron Brassard was one of them. <d>PT1S</d>, he was laughing and smiling. The next second, there was a roaring blast, originating from about 10 feet away, and he looked down to see a \"puddle of blood.\" He later discovered a \"chunk of the leg was just not there.\" His wife was hospitalized, too, and a <kw>friend</kw> lost both her legs. Brassard <kw>told</kw> CNN\\'s Anderson Cooper he is angry. But he\\'s also not about to let this terror change him, any more than it already has. \"You can\\'t let <kw>people</kw> control your life like that,\" Brassard said from his <kw>hospital</kw> bed. \"You just can\\'t.\" The pressure wave from <d>2013</d>\\'s <kw>explosions</kw> in Boston\\'s historic <kw>copley</kw> <kw>square</kw> whipped the once limp international flags straight out, as if they were caught in a hurricane. Some <kw>runners</kw> said they thought the first blast was a celebratory cannon. By the second, there were no such illusions. Some were spectators, like Carlos Arredondo. An affiliate of the Red Cross, he tended to a <kw>man</kw> who\\'d lost two of his limbs. Dr. Natalie Stavas, a pediatric resident at <kw>boston</kw> Children\\'s <kw>hospital</kw>, was near the home stretch of the race she was running with her father when she heard the <kw>blasts</kw>. Despite having run 26 miles, she went over barriers and past policemen, until one stopped her. Stavas <kw>told</kw> <kw>cnn</kw> she <kw>told</kw> him she was a doctor and pleaded, \"You have to let me help, you have to let me through.\" She said she performed CPR on the first person she encountered. For the next two, she worked to halt their bleeding. Stavas stressed that there were hundreds of others doing whatever they could. While <kw>authorities</kw> have given no indication they know who was behind the <kw>attack</kw>, they have offered details on the <kw>devices</kw> used. DesLauriers, from the <kw>fbi</kw>, said the <kw>bombs</kw> were possibly placed in pressure cookers hidden inside a backpack or another black nylon bag. Another <kw>law</kw> <kw>enforcement</kw> <kw>official</kw> <kw>told</kw> <kw>cnn</kw> it was \"likely but not certain\" the <kw>bombs</kw> were on a timer, not set off remotely by a cell phone. Another <kw>federal</kw> <kw>law</kw> <kw>enforcement</kw> <kw>official</kw> said both <kw>bombs</kw> were small, and initial tests showed no C-4 or other high-grade explosive, suggesting the materials used in the <kw>attack</kw> were crude. Those killed include 8-year-old Martin Richard, a resident of the city\\'s Dorchester neighborhood whom babysitter Caitlin Doyle recalled as \"just all-around a wonderful kid (with) a big, bright smile that no one could ever forget.\" Lastly, there was the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>university</kw> graduate student from China -- whom the school and <kw>chinese</kw> consulate declined to identify by name. According to a LinkedIn profile, she graduated from a <kw>chinese</kw> <kw>university</kw> with a degree in international economics and was set to earn her master\\'s degree in mathematics and statistics in <d>2014</d> from B.U. Others survived, thanks largely to the work of emergency personnel and volunteers on-site and scores of professionals in several world-class hospitals nearby. Doctors removed more than a dozen nails from one patient, and three had been struck with metal beads slightly larger than BBs, said Dr. Ron Walls, the emergency medicine chairman at Brigham and Women\\'s <kw>hospital</kw>. Back in <kw>copley</kw> <kw>square</kw>, in the heart of <kw>boston</kw>, investigators on <d>2013</d> continued searching for any hint that might lead them to the perpetrator. <kw>authorities</kw> also pleaded for the public\\'s help. Did they know of anyone who <kw>made</kw> a threat involving <d>2013</d> or the <kw>marathon</kw>? Did they hear <kw>explosions</kw> in a remote <kw>area</kw>, possibly as a test run? And did they spot anyone near the <kw>finish</kw> <kw>line</kw> dropping off what <kw>ended</kw> up being the two <kw>bombs</kw>? By <d>2013</d>, the <kw>fbi</kw> had gotten more than 2,000 tips, DesLauriers said. They\\'d also begun poring over scores of <kw>photos</kw> and <kw>videos</kw> from the <kw>scene</kw>. At one point, 11 Boston-area hospitals had 23 <kw>people</kw> in critical condition and 40 listed as serious. There are still some fighting, with more surgeries planned. But there is progress. In fact, according to a <kw>cnn</kw> tally, at least 100 of the 183 <kw>people</kw> who received treatment were able to go home by <d>2013</d>. As has happened before after such terror <kw>attacks</kw>, <d>2013</d> saw <kw>authorities</kw> responding to alerts and threats -- in places like Dallas, Cleveland and New York -- that all proved to be unfounded. <kw>security</kw> in Los Angeles and New York has been stepped up in light of the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>attack</kw>, and <kw>authorities</kw> in London are reviewing measures for that city\\'s upcoming <kw>marathon</kw>. Back in <kw>massachusetts</kw>, one question is what becomes of the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> -- the world\\'s oldest annual <kw>marathon</kw>, dating to <d>1897</d>, drawing more than 20,000 <kw>participants</kw>. Rather than shutting it down, <kw>officials</kw> promised to build the race back up. That sense of defiance was echoed by Mayor Thomas Menino. Residents and visitors to the city might have to deal with more checks at transit stations and elsewhere. They might have to get used to seeing more <kw>authorities</kw> out and about. But they shouldn\\'t change their attitudes, said the mayor.',\n",
       " 12: \"On <d>2013</d> of <d>2012</d>, a thin kid with a bright smile named <kw>abdulrahman</kw> <kw>alharbi</kw> decided he would stop and watch the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> for <d>PTXM</d>. A Saudi Arabian studying English in <kw>boston</kw>, he had heard of the famous <kw>marathon</kw>, but wanted to see it in the flesh, he later explained to one journalist. <d>UNDEF-REF-minute-PLUS-10</d>, he witnessed what he first mistook for fireworks. Then a second blast rocketed him into the middle of the road. “I realized that my legs were a little bit <kw>hurt</kw> because my jeans were [bloody],” he <kw>told</kw> the Islamic <d>XXXX-XX</d>. “I was bleeding a little bit in my legs, but all my back was all [bloody] not because of my body but because of other peoples’ body.” <kw>alharbi</kw>, like numerous others in the chaotic few hours following the deadly <kw>bombings</kw>, was questioned by <kw>police</kw>. They <kw>asked</kw> for his <kw>facebook</kw> password. He gave it to them. They <kw>asked</kw> to inspect his apartment. He allowed it. News of <kw>alharbi</kw> reached the <kw>media</kw>, but by <d>2013</d>, the cops had cleared the 20-year-old. “He has been checked out,” a <kw>law</kw> <kw>enforcement</kw> <kw>official</kw> <kw>told</kw> the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>globe</kw>. “He is not involved. He is just a victim.” Broadcaster Glenn <kw>beck</kw>, formerly of Fox News, was nonetheless <kw>suspicious</kw> of <kw>alharbi</kw>. He thought the Obama administration was hiding Alharbi’s involvement. So <d>2013</d>, <kw>beck</kw> urged the government to release its information on <kw>alharbi</kw> or else <kw>beck</kw> would “expose” him. “While the <kw>media</kw> continues to look at what the causes were [behind] these two guys, there are, at this hour, three <kw>people</kw> involved,” <kw>beck</kw> said, alleging the U.S. government had “tagged” <kw>alharbi</kw> as a “proven terrorist.” Over several broadcasts, <kw>beck</kw> called <kw>alharbi</kw> the “money man” behind the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>bombings</kw>. “You know who the Saudi is?” <kw>beck</kw> <kw>asked</kw>. “He’s the money <kw>man</kw>. He’s the guy who <kw>paid</kw> for it.” What <kw>beck</kw> said about <kw>alharbi</kw> was untrue. <kw>alharbi</kw> sued <kw>beck</kw> for defamation in <kw>federal</kw> court in <d>2013</d>. And <d>PRESENT_REF</d>, in a batch of little-noticed motions, <kw>beck</kw> has lashed back, saying <kw>alharbi</kw> is trying to “punish” and impede Beck’s First Amendment rights. <kw>beck</kw> argues the <kw>bombings</kw> <kw>made</kw> <kw>alharbi</kw> a “limited purpose” and “involuntary” <kw>public</kw> <kw>figure</kw> who must prove not just that <kw>beck</kw> <kw>made</kw> false accusations, but that <kw>beck</kw> did it with “actual malice.” It’s no surprise that his lawyers would make that argument. Under that standard, whether or not Beck’s claims were false becomes almost irrelevant. In most cases involving <kw>public</kw> figures, malice is so hard to demonstrate that the matter rarely goes to <kw>trial</kw>. First, however, Beck’s lawyers will have to convince a judge that <kw>alharbi</kw> is indeed a <kw>public</kw> <kw>figure</kw>, albeit an involuntary one, someone who thrusts himself into the limelight. What makes <kw>alharbi</kw> a <kw>public</kw> <kw>figure</kw>, according to <kw>beck</kw>? “By behaving suspiciously at the <kw>marathon</kw> finishing <kw>line</kw> when the <kw>bombs</kw> detonated, thereby causing his detention and a background check by <kw>law</kw> enforcement,” states Beck’s motion to dismiss, <kw>alharbi</kw> “embarked on a course of conduct that was reasonably likely to result in <kw>public</kw> attention and comment on his background, activities, and immigration status.” Plus, he gave interviews defending himself, said Beck’s legal team, led by Michael J. Grygiel. Alharbi’s lawyers, led by Peter J. Haley, were incredulous at Beck’s argument. “An individual does not become a <kw>public</kw> <kw>figure</kw> due to the fact that he is investigated in connection with a <kw>crime</kw>, and then states publicly that he was not involved in the <kw>crime</kw> for which he was investigated.” To the extent <kw>alharbi</kw> became known to the <kw>public</kw>, it was because of Beck’s “defamatory reporting.” They <kw>accused</kw> <kw>beck</kw> of “bootstrapping,” creating his own defense by making a <kw>public</kw> <kw>figure</kw> out of <kw>alharbi</kw>. In any case, the student denies he behaved suspiciously — though it’s unclear what would qualify as such a designation. “I [was] really scared because I heard the first bomb, then the second bomb <kw>hurt</kw> me, then, I was really scared because there might be another one,” he <kw>told</kw> Islamic <d>XXXX-XX</d>. “Then, I just was walking and the <kw>people</kw> were crying, ‘What happened, what happened?’ … No one arrested me, no one tackled me, no.” He explained to the publication that some emergency personnel looked at him strangely because of “the color of my skin” and “because of the name of my country.” “They were really scared of me,” he recalled. “I am injured, and I don’t have anything and they <kw>asked</kw> me, ‘What you have in your hand!’ I <kw>told</kw> them, ‘Nothing, it’s just a napkin!’ And then I throw it to them and they were like, ‘Ahh!'” A court hearing is expected in <d>PXW</d>, according to court filings.\",\n",

At the same time, resources were directed to ensure the safety of our community. As soon as those important tasks were completed, first responders focused on establishing a criminal <kw>investigation</kw>. The <kw>fbi</kw> Boston’s Joint <kw>terrorism</kw> Task Force, composed of more than 30 <kw>federal</kw>, state, and local <kw>law</kw> <kw>enforcement</kw> agencies, including <kw>boston</kw> <kw>police</kw>, <kw>massachusetts</kw> State <kw>police</kw>, and ATF, HSI, <kw>united</kw> States Secret Service, and others responded to the <kw>scene</kw>. Many of them were already there as part of the general <kw>security</kw> for the <kw>marathon</kw> already in place. The first step <kw>law</kw> <kw>enforcement</kw> took was to secure the physical <kw>area</kw> around the blast for the purpose of preserving evidence in the <kw>area</kw> related to the <kw>devices</kw> itself. <d>2013</d> the <kw>fbi</kw>, along with <kw>boston</kw> PD, <kw>massachusetts</kw> State <kw>police</kw>, and ATF officially began its forensic evidence recovery effort at the site. Their goal was to recover physical <kw>items</kw> related to the blast. Those <kw>items</kw> have been recovered and sent to the FBI’s Laboratory in Quantico, Virginia. There, specialized examiners will reconstruct the device and determine its makeup and components. Among <kw>items</kw> partially recovered are pieces of black nylon—which could be from a backpack—and what appear to be fragments of BBs and nails possibly contained in a pressure cooker device. We are expediting this blast evidence to our Laboratory in Quantico, Virginia for a complete and thorough analysis.

Among the injured, 17 were <kw>reported</kw> in critical condition. The victims at eight local hospitals were as young as 2. \"There were so many <kw>people</kw> in that <kw>area</kw> that they couldn\\'t get ambulances in there,\" said Joe Difazio, who was working on communications near the site when the <kw>blasts</kw> occurred. \"They were wheeling <kw>people</kw> out in wheelchairs. One guy had no legs. The bones was just sticking out. ... It was horrible.\" WBZ-TV <kw>reported</kw> <d>2013</d> that <kw>police</kw> were searching an apartment in Revere, a suburb, as part of the <kw>investigation</kw> into the <kw>blasts</kw>. <kw>massachusetts</kw> State <kw>police</kw> confirmed that a search warrant was served but provided no further details, Associated <kw>press</kw> said. Set off at one of the world\\'s premiere sporting <kw>events</kw>, the <kw>blasts</kw> ignited a fresh round of unease and renewed <kw>security</kw> concerns across the nation. The stark <kw>pictures</kw> of mayhem and the injured sent over TV and the Internet also rekindled stark memories from the 9/11 terrorist <kw>attacks</kw> on New York\\'s World Trade Center and the Pentagon. <d>2013</d>\\'s <kw>attacks</kw> also come just <d>P4D</d> before the anniversary of the <d>1995</d>, bomb <kw>attack</kw> on Oklahoma City\\'s Murrah <kw>federal</kw> Building. The <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> <kw>blasts</kw> occurred <d>PT12S</d> and 100 <kw>yards</kw> apart at <d>1995</d>, <d>PT3H</d> after Ethiopia\\'s Lelisa Desisa won the 26.2-mile race. <kw>police</kw> searched widely for other explosive <kw>devices</kw>, and two <kw>law</kw> <kw>enforcement</kw> <kw>officials</kw> said no other explosive <kw>devices</kw> had been <kw>found</kw>. The <kw>officials</kw> said that as many as seven <kw>suspicious</kw> <kw>packages</kw> were destroyed in controlled <kw>explosions</kw> but they were later <kw>found</kw> not to be actual <kw>bombs</kw>. The <kw>law</kw> <kw>enforcement</kw> <kw>officials</kw> who have been briefed on the matter were not authorized to comment publicly. <kw>authorities</kw> also issued a bulletin for an unidentified <kw>man</kw> who was seen running from a restricted <kw>area</kw>. It was unclear, according to the <kw>federal</kw> <kw>official</kw>, whether the person was anything other than a witness. The state, local and <kw>federal</kw> <kw>investigation</kw> into the <kw>bombings</kw> is being led by the <kw>fbi</kw>. Special Agent Rick Deslauriers said investigators were looking at possible <kw>terrorism</kw>, but he refused comment on specific <kw>suspects</kw> or leads in the case. \"It is a very active, fluid <kw>investigation</kw> at this time,\\'\\' he said. Speaking from the White House, a somber President Obama said <kw>people</kw> should not speculate over who was responsible. \"We still don\\'t know who did this or why. <kw>people</kw> should not jump to conclusions before we have all the facts. But make no mistake. We will get to the bottom of this. We will find out who did this. We will find out why they did this. Any individual or responsible groups will feel the full weight of <kw>justice</kw>.\" The <kw>devices</kw> were described by the <kw>official</kw> as relatively small and possibly containing small ball bearings or BB gun pellets designed to serve as shrapnel. It was unclear whether the <kw>devices</kw> were remotely detonated or included timers, the <kw>official</kw> said, adding that no conclusions had been drawn on whether an organized group or lone wolf had been responsible for the <kw>attack</kw>. Multiple <kw>media</kw> <kw>reports</kw> indicated a person of interest was being held at an undisclosed <kw>hospital</kw>. But <kw>authorities</kw> later dismissed those <kw>reports</kw>. <kw>davis</kw> said investigators are talking to several <kw>people</kw> but \"there is no <kw>suspect</kw> at this time.\" A third incident at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library was initially described as a third <kw>explosion</kw>, but <kw>davis</kw> said <d>2013</d> that it may have been only a fire. No injuries were <kw>reported</kw>, but nearby universities were being <kw>evacuated</kw>. \"After this incident occurred, there were a lot of <kw>people</kw> running from the <kw>scene</kw>, a lot of them deposited bags and parcels,\" <kw>davis</kw> said. \"Each one is being treated as a <kw>suspicious</kw> device. At this point, we haven\\'t <kw>found</kw> any more <kw>devices</kw>.\" Bloodied spectators were carried to a medical tent intended for <kw>runners</kw>. At least one <kw>police</kw> officer was <kw>hurt</kw>. Organizers stopped the race and locked down the <kw>marathon</kw> headquarters. The <kw>federal</kw> Aviation Administration announced a temporary flight restriction over <kw>boston</kw>. Cellphone service was operating, wireless companies <kw>reported</kw>, contrary to an earlier Associated <kw>press</kw> report quoting a <kw>law</kw> <kw>enforcement</kw> <kw>official</kw> who said service was cut in case there were other undetected <kw>devices</kw>.

About 27,000 <kw>runners</kw> were in the field for the <d>2012</d> race. Nancy Costa, a medical student from Reading, Pa., was running with her <kw>friend</kw> Jill Edmonds of Salem, N.H., when the <kw>explosions</kw> <kw>erupted</kw>. \"It was insane here. Everyone was running. I was right next to the <kw>explosion</kw>. It threw me,\" she said. \"I never sprinted so fast after a <kw>marathon</kw>. \"The first (blast) threw me onto the ground. And everything went silent and then the second went off and I just covered my head and got up and started sprinting. Everyone was screaming and <kw>people</kw> were getting trampled. We finally <kw>found</kw> an open T (subway train) that just arrived in Wellington (station). We had to walk a few miles to find one open.\" Kimberly DelGuzzi of Pittsburgh was waiting on <kw>boylston</kw> <kw>street</kw> for her <kw>friend</kw> to cross the <kw>finish</kw> <kw>line</kw> when she <kw>found</kw> herself pressed against a building, ducking for cover from the <kw>blasts</kw>. \"At first, I thought it was fireworks, but then I saw the smoke go up in the air,\" said DelGuzzi, who was standing between the two <kw>explosions</kw>. \"Then, not even <d>PT1M</d> later, the second one went off.\" She described the <kw>scene</kw> as \"<kw>mass</kw> chaos\" and said, \"Oh my God, it was loud.\" \"The <kw>explosions</kw> shook everything,\" she said, her voice still shaking <d>PT40M</d> after the <kw>bombs</kw> went off. \"I saw <kw>runners</kw> down in the <kw>street</kw>. I saw <kw>people</kw> down on the sidewalk.\" DelGuzzi, 41, has run numerous marathons but was not running in <kw>boston</kw>. Her <kw>friend</kw> <kw>reported</kw> to her that she was OK. Jim <kw>davis</kw>, one of the marathon\\'s <kw>official</kw> photographers, <kw>told</kw> TheDes Moines Register he was about 50 feet from where the first blast ripped through a glass storefront. \"Debris was falling. Fortunately I was far enough away that there weren\\'t any glass shards,\" said <kw>davis</kw>, 65, of Fairfield, Iowa. \"Then <kw>people</kw> started running and screaming and I realized this is not an accident — I should get out of there.\" After the second <kw>explosion</kw>, about a block away, <kw>davis</kw> returned for his camera gear and saw one <kw>man</kw> who had lost both his legs and others who were severely cut. \"I\\'m not a war correspondent,\" he said. \"I\\'m not used to seeing <kw>people</kw> blown up with injuries.\" Tom Beusse, president of the USA TODAY Sports <kw>media</kw> Group, had just finished the race and was about 150 <kw>yards</kw> away from the <kw>explosion</kw>. \"There was this giant <kw>explosion</kw>. All of us turned around, the <kw>runners</kw>, and had these looks on their faces like \\'Oh my God.\\' ... Immediately, it turned into mayhem. <kw>people</kw> were screaming. Cops <kw>told</kw> us to keep moving away from the <kw>finish</kw> <kw>line</kw> in the direction we were going. No one knew what was coming next — and thankfully, nothing was next.\" <kw>massachusetts</kw> General <kw>hospital</kw> was treating 19 victims, spokeswoman Susan McGreevey said. Six were in surgery in critical condition, four suffering \"traumatic amputations\" from having legs cut off by the force of the <kw>explosions</kw>. Tufts Medical Center had nine patients \"and we\\'re expecting more,\" said spokeswoman Julie Jette. Brigham and Women\\'s <kw>hospital</kw> <kw>reported</kw> receiving 18 to 20 injured from the <kw>explosions</kw>, two in critical condition. As night fell at Brigham and Women\\'s <kw>hospital</kw>, a Level 1 trauma center, three <kw>police</kw> officers with rifles stood guard at the front entrance. Inside, physicians cared for 28 victims of the <kw>boylston</kw> <kw>street</kw> blast, including two in critical condition, two at risk of losing limbs and nine who needed surgery. Staff throughout the <kw>hospital</kw> felt the impact of the day\\'s <kw>events</kw>. <kw>social</kw> worker Laura Taylor was among those not allowed to leave at <d>2012</d> due to a lockdown to ensure <kw>security</kw>, but instead stayed past <d>2012</d> As she checked on patients, other <kw>social</kw> workers and psychologists tended to family members in expanded waiting areas. \"We\\'ve had other emergencies over <d>P7Y</d> I\\'ve worked here, but nothing where we had to go into lockdown,\" Taylor said. \"This had a level of intensity greater than anything else, just knowing what was happening outside.\" Others gathered outside to comfort one another. Marathoner Kirsten Scott was still wearing her number as she talked with a <kw>friend</kw> and thought about her husband, a surgery resident tending to patients. \"We\\'re just praying,\" she said. The most <kw>common</kw> injuries were to bones and tissues. Among the youngest, a 3-year-old was transferred to <kw>boston</kw> Children\\'s <kw>hospital</kw> for treatment. Michael Malcolm, a concierge at the Bryant Back Bay apartment building who was a couple of blocks from the race <kw>finish</kw> <kw>line</kw>, heard the <kw>blasts</kw>, but said they didn\\'t register until he saw crowds of <kw>runners</kw> coming up the <kw>street</kw>, some knocking on the front door of the building asking if they could use his telephone or plug in their cellphones to let loved ones know they were safe. At one point, a perpetual wail of sirens was so loud that <kw>people</kw> had to shout when talking to one another, he said. \"It\\'s scary because we\\'re not used to things happening like this in this city,\" said Malcolm, 21. <kw>police</kw> <kw>evacuated</kw> a 15-block <kw>area</kw> around Boston\\'s <kw>copley</kw> <kw>square</kw> and bolstered <kw>security</kw> around the city. <kw>security</kw> was also increased around Washington and New York. The New York <kw>police</kw> Department has stepped up <kw>security</kw> around landmarks in Manhattan, including near prominent <kw>hotels</kw>, said Paul Browne, deputy commissioner of the NYPD. \"New Yorkers should be alert. And we ask them to be aware of their surroundings and if they see anything <kw>suspicious</kw>, <kw>call</kw> our resources, <kw>call</kw> 911,\" New York City <kw>police</kw> Commissioner Raymond Kelly said. \"We\\'ve had the experience here of significant <kw>events</kw> and plots against us, so we would hope that New Yorkers are vigilant,\" said Kelly, referring to the 9/11 terrorist <kw>attack</kw>, the <d>1993</d> World Trade Center <kw>bombing</kw> and other major incidents. \"We are in the cross hairs of terrorists, and we don\\'t believe the threat has diminished very much. We don\\'t know the genesis of this. We don\\'t know who\\'s responsible for it. But we sort of have to have a 360-degree perimeter in this city and other cities as well, obviously.\"',\n",

His <kw>trial</kw> was the first stemming from the <kw>bombing</kw>, which killed three and injured more than 260 near the marathon\\'s <kw>finish</kw> <kw>line</kw>. <kw>tazhayakov</kw> put his hands over his face and shook his head as the jury announced the verdicts, which it reached on the third day of deliberations.

Instead, we can specify a more fine-grained granularity, such as `year` and a `begin` and `end date` which would result in the following code: `results = Time_Matters_SingleDoc(text, temporal_tagger=['rule_based', 'year', 2000, 2011])`.

For instance n = 1 means that single tokens such as \"keyword\" can be considered; instead n = 2 means that \"keyword\" but also \"keyword extractor\" can be considered). More about this [here](https://github.com/LIAAD/Time-Matters#Text-Representation) and [here](https://github.com/LIAAD/Time-Matters#Relevant-Keywords). \n",
    "- **num_of_keywords**: number of YAKE! keywords to extract from the text. Default value is *10* (but any value > 0 is considered) meaning that the system will extract 10 relevant keywords from the text. More about this [here](https://github.com/LIAAD/Time-Matters#Text-Representation) and [here](https://github.com/LIAAD/Time-Matters#Relevant-Keywords). \n",
    "- **n_contextual_window**: defines the n-contextual window distance. Default value is \"*full_document*\" when the score type is ByCorpus, or \"*full_sentence*\" (but a n-window where n > 0 can be considered as alternative) when the score type is ByDoc or ByDocSentence. More about this [here](https://github.com/LIAAD/Time-Matters#Computing-Dice).\n",
    "- **N**: size of the context vector for X and Y at InfoSimba. Default value is '10' (but any value > 0 is considered). You can also define 'max' meaning that the context vector should have the maximum number of n-terms co-occurring with X (likewise with Y). This option however will require a huge amount of time (depending on the PC) to execute. More about this [here](https://github.com/LIAAD/Time-Matters#Context-Vectors).\n",
    "- **TH**: minimum threshold value from which terms are eligible to the context vector X and Y at InfoSimba. Default value is *0.05* (but any value > 0 is considered) meaning that any terms co-occuring between them with a DICE similarity value > 0.05 are eligible for the n-size vector.

       "{0: 'The <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> <kw>bombing</kw> was a terrorist attack, followed by subsequent related shootings, that occurred when two pressure cooker bombs exploded during the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> on <d>2013-04-15</d>. The bombs exploded <d>PT12S</d> and 210 yards (190 m) apart at <d>2013-04-15T14:49</d> EDT, near the marathon\\'s <kw>finish line</kw> on <kw>boylston street</kw>. The explosion killed 3 civilians and injured an estimated 264 others. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (<kw>fbi</kw>) took over the investigation and, on <d>2013-04-18</d>, released photographs and a surveillance <kw>video</kw> of two suspects. The suspects were identified later that day as Chechen brothers <kw>dzhokhar tsarnaev</kw> and <kw>tamerlan tsarnaev</kw>. Shortly after the <kw>fbi</kw> released identifying images publicly, the suspects killed an MIT policeman, carjacked a civilian SUV, and initiated an exchange of gunfire with the <kw>police</kw> in nearby Watertown. During the firefight, a <kw>massachusetts</kw> Bay Transportation Authority <kw>police</kw> officer was injured but survived with severe blood loss. A <kw>boston police department</kw> officer was also injured and died from his wounds <d>2014</d>. <kw>tamerlan tsarnaev</kw> was shot several times in the firefight and his brother subsequently ran him over with the stolen SUV in his escape. Tamerlan died shortly after arriving at Boston\\'s Beth Israel Hospital. An unprecedented manhunt for <kw>dzhokhar tsarnaev</kw> ensued on <d>2014-04-19</d>, with thousands of <kw>law enforcement</kw> officers searching a 20-block area of Watertown. During the manhunt, authorities asked residents of Watertown and surrounding areas, including <kw>boston</kw>, to stay indoors. The public transportation system and most businesses and public institutions were shut down, creating a deserted urban environment of historic size and duration. <d>2014-04-19T18:00</d>, shortly after the \"shelter-in-place\" advisory was rescinded, a Watertown resident discovered Dzhokhar hiding in a boat in his back yard. Reports conflict as to whether or not he was armed. Located within the boat by thermal imaging, he was shot while in the boat, arrested, and then taken to a hospital shortly thereafter. During an initial interrogation in the hospital, Dzhokhar alleged that Tamerlan was the mastermind. He said they were motivated by extremist Islamist beliefs and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and that they were self-radicalized and unconnected to any outside terrorist groups. According to him, they <kw>learned</kw> to build explosive devices from an online magazine of the al-Qaeda affiliate in Yemen. He said that he and his brother had decided after the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>bombing</kw> to travel to New York City to bomb Times Square. Dzhokhar was indicted on <d>2014-04-22</d>, while still in the hospital, on 30 charges relating to homegrown terrorism, including use of a <kw>weapon of mass</kw> destruction and malicious destruction of property resulting in death. He was found guilty on all charges on <d>2015-04-08</d>, and <d>2015-05</d> was sentenced to death. On <d>2015-09-11</d>, <d>2013-04-15</d>, the 117th annual <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> began without any signs of an imminent attack. <kw>officials</kw> swept the area for bombs twice before the <kw>explosions</kw>; the second sweep occurred <d>PT1H</d> before the bombs went off. <kw>people</kw> were able to come and go freely and carry bags and items in and out of the area. At <d>2013-04-15T14:49</d> EDT (18:49 UTC), <d>PT3H</d> after the winner crossed the <kw>finish line</kw>, but with more than 5,700 runners yet to finish, two bombs detonated on <kw>boylston street</kw> near <kw>copley square</kw> about 210 yards (190 m) apart, just before the <kw>finish line</kw>. The first exploded outside <kw>marathon</kw> Sports at 671–673 <kw>boylston street</kw> at <d>2013-04-15T14:49</d> EDT. At the time of the first explosion, the race clock at the <kw>finish line</kw> showed 04:09:43, reflecting the elapsed time since the Wave 3 start at <d>2013-04-15T10:40</d> EDT. The second bomb exploded at <d>2013-04-15T14:49</d> EDT, <d>PT13S</d> later and one block farther west at 755 <kw>boylston street</kw>. The blasts blew out windows on adjacent buildings but did not cause any structural damage. Some runners continued to cross the line until <d>2013-04-15T14:57</d> EDT, <d>PT8M</d> after the <kw>explosions</kw>. Rescue workers and medical personnel, on hand to assist runners and bystanders, rushed available aid to wounded victims in the bombing\\'s immediate aftermath. Additional emergency units from <kw>boston</kw> EMS, the <kw>boston police department</kw>, and the <kw>boston</kw> Fire Department were dispatched to assist emergency responders already on-scene. A mutual aid request was sent and additional private ambulances responded. The <kw>explosions</kw> killed 3 civilians and injured an estimated 264 others, who were treated in 27 local hospitals. At least 14 <kw>people</kw> required amputations, with some suffering traumatic amputations as a direct result of the blasts. The <kw>marathon</kw> was halted abruptly. <kw>boston</kw> <kw>police</kw>, following emergency plans, diverted the remaining runners away from the <kw>finish line</kw> to <kw>boston</kw> Common and Kenmore Square. The nearby <kw>lenox</kw> Hotel and other buildings were evacuated. <kw>police</kw> closed down a 15-block area around the blast site; this was reduced to a 12-block crime scene on <d>2013-04-16</d>. <kw>massachusetts</kw> Army National Guard soldiers already at the scene joined local authorities in rendering aid. <kw>boston</kw> <kw>police</kw> commissioner Edward F. <kw>davis</kw> recommended that <kw>people</kw> stay off the streets. Many civilians dropped backpacks and other bags as they fled, requiring each to be treated as a potential bomb. A number of news reports stated that more bombs had been found nearby and the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>police</kw> Bomb Squad said they would perform a controlled explosion on the 600 block of <kw>boylston street</kw>, but in the end no other bombs were found. Some media outlets also reported a potential <kw>bombing</kw> at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library in the Dorchester section of the city, but this turned out to be an unrelated electrical fire. The Navy sent one of its EOD (Explosive Ordinance Disposal) to <kw>boston</kw> to help local authorities. As a precaution, the Federal Aviation Administration restricted airspace over <kw>boston</kw>, and issued a temporary ground stop for Boston\\'s Logan International Airport. Some <kw>massachusetts</kw> Bay Transportation Authority service was halted. Several cities in <kw>massachusetts</kw> and other states put their <kw>police</kw> forces on alert. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder directed that the \"full resources\" of the U.S. Department of Justice be brought to bear on investigating the <kw>explosions</kw>. The <kw>massachusetts</kw> Emergency Management Agency suggested <kw>people</kw> trying to contact those in the vicinity use text messaging instead of voice calls because of crowded cellphone lines. Cellphone service in <kw>boston</kw> was congested but remained in operation, despite some local media reports stating that cell service was shut down to prevent cell phones from being used as detonators. The American Red Cross helped concerned friends and family receive information about runners and casualties. The <kw>boston police department</kw> also set up a helpline for <kw>people</kw> concerned about relatives or acquaintances to contact and a line for <kw>people</kw> to provide information. Google Person Finder activated their disaster service under <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> <kw>explosions</kw> to log known information about missing persons as a publicly viewable file Because of the closure of several <kw>hotels</kw> near the blast zone, some out-of-town visitors were left with nowhere to stay; many Boston-area residents opened their homes to them. The Federal Bureau of Investigation led the investigation, assisted by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Counterterrorism Center, and the Drug Enforcement Administration, and named two official suspects. United States government <kw>officials</kw> stated that there had been no intelligence reports that indicated such a <kw>bombing</kw> would take place. Representative Peter King, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, said: \"I received two top secret briefings <d>2013-W15</d> on the <d>PRESENT_REF</d> threat levels in the United States, and there was no evidence of this at all.\" Following the identification of the suspects, their father claimed that the <kw>fbi</kw> had been watching his family and questioned his sons in Cambridge, <kw>massachusetts</kw>, five times in relation to possible <kw>explosions</kw> on the streets of <kw>boston</kw>. At the site of the explosion, investigators found shrapnel that included bits of metal, nails, and bearing balls, as well as black nylon pieces from a backpack. The lid of a pressure cooker was found on a nearby rooftop. Investigators also found the remains of an electronic circuit board and wiring. All evidence was sent to the <kw>fbi</kw> Laboratory for analysis. Both of the improvised explosive devices were pressure cooker bombs, manufactured by the bombers. Authorities reportedly confirmed that the brothers used bomb making instructions found in Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula\\'s Inspire. After the suspects were identified, The <kw>boston</kw> <kw>globe</kw> reported that Tamerlan purchased fireworks from a fireworks store in New Hampshire. On <d>2013-04-19</d>, the <kw>fbi</kw>, West New York <kw>police</kw> Department, and Hudson County Sheriff\\'s Department seized computer equipment from the suspects\\' sister\\'s apartment located in West New York, New Jersey. On <d>2013-04-24</d>, the <kw>fbi</kw> and the Department of Homeland Security released a joint intelligence bulletin which the Los Angeles Times reports to include the \"preliminary analysis of recovered evidence, [for] each device\". The report says investigators believe that the two homemade bombs used were triggered by long-range remote controls used for toy cars; and that investigators have finished a preliminary reconstruction of the bombs that were used during the <d>2013-04-15</d> <kw>attacks</kw>. In a news conference held at <d>2013-04-15T17:20</d> on <d>2013-04-18</d>, the <kw>fbi</kw> released photographs and surveillance videos showing two suspects—each carrying a backpack, and walking one behind the other—and sought the public\\'s help in identifying them. The <kw>fbi</kw> released the photos, in part, to limit the damage by those wrongly targeted by incorrect news reports and <kw>social media</kw> speculations. Authorities later said that releasing the suspects\\' photos \"was a turning point in the investigation, no doubt about it.\" Jeff Bauman, a victim who lost both legs, was adjacent to the location of one of the bombs; upon recovering consciousness, he asked for pen and paper and wrote a note to the <kw>fbi</kw>, \"bag, saw the guy, looked right at me\". Bauman was later able to provide detailed descriptions to the authorities of a suspect who was seen placing a backpack beside him at the <kw>bombing</kw> scene two and a half minutes before it exploded, enabling the photo to be identified and circulated quickly. The suspects, initially identified by the <kw>fbi</kw> as unnamed suspects 1 and 2 (or \"black hat\" and \"white hat\", respectively) from photographic and <kw>video</kw> evidence, had \"acted differently\" after the <kw>explosions</kw>; they had stayed to watch the aftermath and walked away \"casually\", rather than fleeing. Asked for assistance in identifying the suspects, the public provided a deluge of photographs and home movie records to <kw>police</kw>, which were scrutinized by both authorities and online public social networks. Despite <kw>video</kw> footage taken at the scene, the suspects were not identified by authorities before killing a <kw>police</kw> officer and hijacking a civilian vehicle. The source of identification was RMV records on the Honda vehicle, which was used in a subsequent kidnapping and then abandoned. The suspects were then identified as two brothers whose family had immigrated to the United States as asylees around <d>2002</d>: 26-year-old <kw>tamerlan tsarnaev</kw> and 19-year-old <kw>dzhokhar tsarnaev</kw>. <d>PTXH</d> after the photos were released, the suspects shot Sean A. Collier of the <kw>massachusetts</kw> Institute of Technology <kw>police</kw> Department six times, killing him for his gun, which they could not get out because of the holster\\'s retention system. Collier, aged 27, was seated in his <kw>police</kw> car near the Stata Center (Building 32), on the <kw>massachusetts</kw> Institute of Technology campus. He was taken to <kw>massachusetts</kw> General Hospital in nearby downtown <kw>boston</kw>, where he was pronounced dead. Some <kw>law enforcement</kw> <kw>officials</kw> described the killing as an assassination. The duo then carjacked a Mercedes-Benz M-Class SUV in the Allston-Brighton neighborhood of <kw>boston</kw>; Tamerlan took the owner hostage and told him that he was responsible for the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>bombing</kw> and for killing a <kw>police</kw> officer. Dzhokhar followed them in the green Honda, later joining them in the Mercedes-Benz. Interrogation later allegedly revealed that the brothers \"decided spontaneously\" that they wanted to go to New York and bomb Times Square. The suspects forced the hostage to use his ATM cards to obtain $800 in cash until the daily cash withdrawal limit was reached. They transferred objects to the Mercedes-Benz and one brother followed it in their Honda Civic, for which an all-points bulletin was issued. The car\\'s owner, a Chinese national named Dun Meng (referred to only as \"Danny\" in early reports), escaped while the suspects stopped at a gas station; he ran across the street to another gas station, asking the clerk to call 911. His cellphone remained in the vehicle, allowing the <kw>police</kw> to focus their search on Watertown. Shortly after midnight on <d>2002-04-19</d>, a Watertown <kw>police</kw> officer, Joseph Reynolds, identified the brothers in a Honda Civic and the stolen SUV. A gunfight followed on the 100 block of Laurel St, between the brothers and <kw>police</kw> arriving at the scene. An estimated 200 to 300 rounds of ammunition were fired and at least one further bomb and several \"crude grenades\" were thrown. According to Watertown <kw>police</kw> Chief Edward Deveau, the brothers had an \"arsenal of guns.\" The older brother, Tamerlan, ran out of ammunition and threw his empty pistol at Sergeant Jeffrey Pugliese, who tackled him with assistance from Sergeant John MacLellan. The younger brother Dzhokhar then drove the stolen SUV toward <kw>police</kw> and Tamerlan; Pugliese attempted to drag Tamerlan to safety at danger of his own life, but was unsuccessful. Dzhokhar ran over his brother, dragging him a short distance down the street. <kw>dzhokhar tsarnaev</kw> sped off, but about a half-mile away at the corner of Spruce and Lincoln streets he abandoned the car and escaped on foot. Upon searching the scene, only one firearm, a Ruger 9 mm pistol with a defaced serial number, was recovered. Within a <d>PT10M</d> span, officers fired many rounds, peppering the area and leaving over a dozen nearby houses with scores of bullet holes. <kw>tamerlan tsarnaev</kw> was transported to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead on <d>2002-04-19</d> at <d>2002-04-19T01:35</d> According to the death certificate, Tsarnaev\\'s cause of death was \"gunshot wounds of torso and extremities, blunt trauma to head and torso,\" and \"shot by <kw>police</kw> then run over and dragged by motor vehicle.\" The death was ruled a homicide. During the firefight, 33-year-old MBTA <kw>police</kw> Officer Richard H. Donohue Jr. was also critically wounded by what may have been friendly fire. He was taken to Mount Auburn Hospital with a bullet wound to the thigh and life-threatening blood loss, but he survived. <kw>boston police department</kw> officer Dennis Simmonds died on <d>2014-04-10</d>, as a result of injuries he sustained from a hand grenade at the Watertown shootout, bringing the total number of fatalities to five. Fifteen other <kw>police</kw> officers sustained minor injuries during the firefight,. A 50-page report on the manhunt produced by Harvard Kennedy School\\'s Program on Crisis Leadership found that a lack of coordination between the <kw>police</kw> agencies involved put the public at excessive risk during the shootout. The <kw>fbi</kw> released additional photos of the two during the Watertown incident. Early on <d>2014-04-19</d>, Watertown residents received reverse 911 calls asking them to stay indoors. On <d>2014-04-19TMO</d>, Governor Patrick asked residents of Watertown and adjacent cities and towns (Allston-Brighton, <kw>boston</kw>, Belmont, Brookline, Cambridge, Newton, and Waltham) to \"shelter in place\". Somerville residents also received a reverse-911 call with orders to shelter in place. A 20-block area of Watertown was cordoned off and residents were told not to leave their homes or answer the door as officers in tactical gear scoured the area. Helicopters circled the area and SWAT teams in armored vehicles moved through in formation, with officers going door-to-door. On the scene were the <kw>fbi</kw>, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Department of Homeland Security, the National Guard, the <kw>boston</kw> and Watertown <kw>police</kw> departments and the <kw>massachusetts state police</kw>. The show of force was the first major field test of the interagency task forces created in the wake of the <d>2014-09-11</d> <kw>attacks</kw>. The entire public transit network, as well as most <kw>boston</kw> taxi service, was suspended, as was Amtrak service to and from <kw>boston</kw>. Logan International Airport remained open under heightened security. Universities, schools, many businesses, and other facilities were closed as thousands of <kw>law enforcement</kw> personnel participated in an unprecedented door-to-door manhunt in Watertown, as well as following up other leads, including at the house the brothers shared in Cambridge. Seven improvised explosive devices were recovered by bomb squads. The father of the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> bombers, speaking from his home in Makhachkala, Dagestan, encouraged his son to: \"Give up. Give up. You have a bright future ahead of you. Come home to Russia.\" He continued, \"If they killed him, then all hell would break loose.\" On television, Dzhokhar\\'s uncle from Montgomery Village, Maryland, pleaded with him to turn himself in. The manhunt ended on <d>2014-04-19TEV</d>, <d>PT2H</d> after the shelter-in-place order had been lifted. Outside the search area, a Watertown resident stepped outside and noticed that the cover on his boat in his back yard was loose. He looked into the boat and saw a body lying in a pool of blood, and he promptly notified <kw>police</kw>. Authorities surrounded the boat and verified movement through a forward looking infrared thermal imaging device in a State <kw>police</kw> helicopter. When the suspect started poking at the tarp of the boat, <kw>police</kw> began a large volume of gunfire at the boat, stopping only after the Superintendent on the scene called for a cease fire. Celebrations followed law enforcement\\'s capture of <kw>tsarnaev</kw>. According to <kw>boston</kw> <kw>police</kw> Commissioner Ed <kw>davis</kw>, and Watertown <kw>police</kw> Chief Deveau, <kw>tsarnaev</kw> was shooting from inside the boat at <kw>police</kw>, \"exchanging fire for <d>PT1H</d>.\" After he was captured, <kw>tsarnaev</kw> was found not to have any weapons. He was taken into custody at <d>2014-04-19T20:42</d> and transported to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, where he was listed in critical condition with multiple gunshot wounds to the head, neck, legs and hand. Initial reports that the neck wound was from a self-inflicted gunshot from a possible suicide attempt were later contradicted by the revelation that he was unarmed at the time of capture and a description of the neck wound by SWAT team members that the neck wound was a slicing injury, possibly caused by shrapnel from an explosion. United States Senators Kelly Ayotte, Saxby Chambliss, Lindsey Graham, and John McCain, and Representative Peter T. King, suggested that <kw>dzhokhar tsarnaev</kw>, a U.S. citizen, should be tried as an unlawful enemy combatant rather than as a criminal, potentially preventing him from obtaining legal counsel. Other sources, including Alan Dershowitz, a prominent American legal scholar and lawyer, said that doing so would be illegal and would jeopardize the prosecution. The government decided to try Dzhokhar in the federal criminal court system and not as an enemy combatant. Dzhokhar was questioned for <d>PT16H</d> by investigators but stopped communicating with them on <d>2014-04-22TNI</d> after Judge Marianne Bowler read him a Miranda warning. Dzhokhar had not previously been given a Miranda warning, as <kw>federal law enforcement</kw> <kw>officials</kw> invoked the warning\\'s public safety exception. This raised doubts whether the suspect\\'s statements during this investigation would be admissible as evidence and led to a debate surrounding Miranda rights. On <d>2013-04-22</d>, formal criminal charges were brought against <kw>tsarnaev</kw> in the United States District Court for the District of <kw>massachusetts</kw> during a bedside hearing while he was hospitalized. He was charged with use of a <kw>weapon of mass</kw> destruction, and with malicious destruction of property resulting in death. Some of the charges carry potential sentences of life imprisonment or the death penalty. <kw>tsarnaev</kw> was judged to be awake, mentally competent, and lucid, and he responded to most questions by nodding. When the judge asked him whether he was able to afford an attorney, he responded \"no\"; he was represented by the Federal Public Defender\\'s office. On <d>2013-04-26</d>, Dzhohkar <kw>tsarnaev</kw> was moved from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center to the Federal Medical Center at Fort Devens, about 40 miles (64 km) from <kw>boston</kw>. FMC Devens is a federal prison medical facility at a former Army base where he was held in solitary confinement at a segregated housing unit with <d>PT23H</d>-per-day lockdown. On <d>2013-07-10</d>, <kw>tsarnaev</kw> pleaded not guilty to 30 charges in his first public court appearance, including a murder charge for MIT <kw>police</kw> officer Sean Collier. He was back in court for a status hearing on <d>2013-09-23</d>, and his lawyers requested more time to prepare their defense. On <d>2013-10-02</d>, Tsarnaev\\'s attorneys asked the court to lift the special administrative measures (SAMs) imposed by Attorney General Holder in <d>2013-08</d>, saying the measures had left <kw>tsarnaev</kw> unduly isolated from communication with his family and lawyers, and that no evidence suggests he poses a future threat. Judge George O\\'Toole ruled on <d>2014-09-24</d>, that the trial would begin on <d>2015-01-05</d>, <d>2015-03</d> than planned, due to the extensive amount of evidence needed to be examined by both sides. He said the defense motion for a lengthier delay, until <d>2015-09</d>, was not warranted. He also ruled that the defense had failed to demonstrate that media coverage had \"so inflamed and pervasively prejudiced the [potential area jury] pool that a fair and impartial jury could not be empaneled in the district\", refusing their request for a change of venue to Washington, D.C. On <d>2014-12-18</d>, <kw>tsarnaev</kw> attended a pre-trial hearing, his first time in public since <d>2013-07</d>. The jury selection began on <d>2015-01-05</d>, with an initial pool of 1373 prospective jurors filling out questionnaires. On <d>2015-02-25</d>, Judge George O\\'Toole, along with the prosecution and defense teams, settled on a pool of 70 jury prospects after questioning 256 <kw>people</kw> <d>P21D</d> of individual interviews. On <d>2015-03-03</d>, the jury, composed of eight men and 10 women (six of which were alternates), was selected. The trial began in federal court in <kw>boston</kw> on <d>2015-03-04</d>, with opening statements. Assistant U.S. Attorney William Weinreb, speaking for the prosecution, vividly described the scene of the <kw>bombing</kw> and attempted to paint Dzhokhar as \"a soldier in a holy war against Americans\" whose motive was \"reaching paradise\", and that he acted as an equal participant. Defense attorney Judy Clarke declared in her opening statement that \"It was him\"—that it was <kw>dzhokhar tsarnaev</kw> who had placed the second bomb at the <kw>finish line</kw> and was <kw>present</kw> at the murder of Sean Collier, at the carjacking of Dun Meng, and at the Watertown shootout, but she then laid out an argument aimed at saving <kw>tsarnaev</kw> from the death penalty by showing the influence that his older brother had and that Dzhokhar was merely a follower. Between <d>2015-03-04</d> and <d>2015-03-30</d>, prosecutors called more than 90 witnesses <d>P15D</d> of testimony, including <kw>bombing</kw> survivors who described losing limbs in the attack, and the government rested its case on <d>2015-03-30</d>. On <d>2015-03-31</d>, after calling four witnesses overall, the defense team representing <kw>tsarnaev</kw> finished presenting its case in the guilt phase. Following closing statements on <d>2015-04-06</d>, <kw>tsarnaev</kw> was found guilty on all 30 counts as the verdict was reached on <d>2015-04-08</d>. It took <d>PT26M</d> to read the verdict that included convictions on weapons, <kw>bombing</kw>, conspiracy, and murder charges. Of the 30 counts, 17 carry the possibility of the death penalty. The sentencing phase of the trial was on <d>2015-04-21</d>. On <d>2015-06-24</d>, <kw>tsarnaev</kw> was formally sentenced to death after he apologized to the victims for the <kw>bombings</kw>. According to <kw>fbi</kw> interrogators, Dzhokhar and his brother were motivated by extremist Islamic beliefs, but \"were not connected to any known terrorist groups\"; instead learning to build explosive weapons from an online magazine published by al-Qaeda affiliates in Yemen. They further alleged that \"[Dzhokhar and] his brother considered suicide <kw>attacks</kw> and striking on <d>2015-07-04</d>; but ultimately decided to use pressure cooker bombs (capable of remote detonation) and other IEDs.\" Fox News reported that the brothers \"chose the prestigious race as a \\'target of opportunity\\' ... [after] the building of the bombs came together more quickly than expected\". Dzhokhar said he and his brother wanted to defend Islam from the U.S., which conducted the Iraq War and War in Afghanistan, in the view of the brothers, against Muslims. Later a CBS report revealed that a note scrawled by Dzhokhar with a marker on the interior wall of the boat where he was hiding said the <kw>bombing</kw> were \"retribution for U.S. military action in Afghanistan and Iraq\", and called the <kw>boston</kw> victims \"collateral damage\", \"in the same way innocent victims have been collateral damage in U.S. wars around the world.\" According to The New York Times, the portion of the boat\\'s interior with the note would likely be cut from the hull with permission from the owner and presented in court as evidence. Despite the seemingly outwardly religious motivation of the <kw>tsarnaev</kw> brothers, some political science and public policy scholars suggest that Islam may have played only a secondary role in the <kw>attacks</kw>. Sympathy towards the political aspirations in the Caucasus region and Tamerlan\\'s inability to become fully integrated into American society appear to be the primary motives, in their opinion. According to The Los Angeles Times, a <kw>law enforcement official</kw> said Dzhokhar \"did not seem as bothered about America\\'s role in the Muslim world\" as his brother Tamerlan had been. Dzhokhar identified Tamerlan as the \"driving force\" behind the <kw>bombing</kw>, and said that his brother had only <d>PAST_REF</d> recruited him to help. <kw>tamerlan tsarnaev</kw> was born in <d>1986</d> in the Kalmyk Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, North Caucasus. Dzhokhar was born in <d>1993</d> in Kyrgyzstan, although some reports say his family claims he was born in Dagestan. The family spent time in Tokmok, Kyrgyzstan, and in Makhachkala, Dagestan. They are half Chechen through their father, Anzor, and half Avar through their mother, Zubeidat. Although they never lived in Chechnya, the brothers self-identified as Chechen. The <kw>tsarnaev</kw> family emigrated in <d>2002</d> to the United States, where they applied for political asylum, settling in Cambridge, <kw>massachusetts</kw>. <kw>tamerlan tsarnaev</kw> attended Bunker Hill Community College but dropped out to become a boxer. His goal was a place on the U.S. Olympic boxing team saying that \"unless his native Chechnya becomes independent\" he would \"rather compete for the United States than for Russia\". He was married on <d>2010-07-15</d>, in the Masjid Al Quran Mosque in the Dorchester section of the city, to a U.S. citizen, Katherine Russell, who was pregnant with their daughter. He stated that he \"didn\\'t understand\" Americans and had not a single American friend. He had a history of violence, including an arrest in <d>2009-07</d> for assaulting his then-girlfriend. The brothers are Muslim, with Tamerlan\\'s aunt stating that he had <d>PAST_REF</d> become a devout Muslim. Tamerlan, since <d>2009</d>, became more devout and religious, and a YouTube channel in his name linked to Salafist and Islamist videos. The <kw>fbi</kw> was informed by the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) in <d>2011</d> that he was a \"follower of <kw>radical islam</kw>.\" In response, the <kw>fbi</kw> interviewed Tamerlan and his family, and searched databases, but did not find any evidence of \"terrorism activity, domestic or foreign.\" During the <d>2012</d> trip to Dagestan, Tamerlan was reportedly a frequent visitor at a mosque on Kotrova Street in Makhachkala, believed by the FSB to be linked with <kw>radical islam</kw>. Some experts believe \"they were motivated by their faith, apparently an anti-American, radical version of Islam\" acquired in the U.S., while others believe the turn to radicalism happened in Dagestan. At the time of the <kw>bombing</kw>, <kw>dzhokhar tsarnaev</kw> was a student at the University of <kw>massachusetts</kw> Dartmouth, with a major in marine biology. Dzhokhar became a naturalized U.S. citizen on <d>2012-09-11</d>. Tamerlan\\'s boxing coach reported to NBC that the young brother was greatly affected by his brother and admired him. <kw>tamerlan tsarnaev</kw> was previously connected, but at the time not a suspect, to the triple homicide in Waltham, <kw>massachusetts</kw>, on <d>2011-09-11TEV</d>. Brendan Mess, Erik Weissman and Raphael Teken were murdered in Mess\\'s apartment. All had their throats slit from ear to ear, with such great force that they were nearly decapitated. The local district attorney said that it appeared that the killer and the victims knew each other, and that the murders were not random. <kw>tamerlan tsarnaev</kw> had previously described murder victim Brendan Mess as his \"best friend.\" After the <kw>bombing</kw> and subsequent revelations of Tsarnaev\\'s personal life, the Waltham murders case was reexamined in <d>2013-04</d> with <kw>tsarnaev</kw> as a new suspect. Both ABC and The New York Times have reported that there is strong evidence that implicates <kw>tsarnaev</kw> in this triple homicide. Some analysts claim the <kw>tsarnaev</kw> brothers\\' mother, Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, is a radical extremist and supporter of jihad, who influenced her sons\\' behavior. This prompted the Russian government to warn the U.S. government about the family\\'s behavior, on two occasions. Both Tamerlan and his mother were placed on a terrorism watch list <d>P18M</d> before the <kw>bombing</kw> took place. According to a Wall Street Journal report citing statements by anonymous U.S. <kw>officials</kw>, Russia denied U.S. requests for more information after its initial warning. Other arrests, detentions, and prosecutions On <d>2013-04-15</d>, several <kw>people</kw> who were near the scene of the blast were taken into custody and questioned about the <kw>bombing</kw>, including a Saudi man whom <kw>police</kw> stopped as he was walking away from the explosion, and detained when some of his responses to questions \"made them uncomfortable.\" <kw>law enforcement</kw> searched his residence in a <kw>boston</kw> suburb. The man was found to have no connection to the attack; an unnamed U.S. official said, \"he was just at the wrong place at the wrong time.\" On <d>2013-04-18TNI</d>, two men riding in a taxi in the vicinity of the shootout were arrested and released shortly thereafter when <kw>police</kw> determined they were not involved in the <kw>marathon</kw> <kw>attacks</kw>. Another man was arrested several blocks from the site of the shootout and was forced to strip naked by <kw>police</kw> who feared he might have concealed explosives. He was released that evening after a brief investigation determined that he was an innocent bystander. On <d>2013-05-22</d>, the <kw>fbi</kw> interrogated Ibragim Todashev, a Chechen from <kw>boston</kw>, in Orlando, Florida. During the interrogation he was shot and killed by an <kw>fbi</kw> agent who claimed that Todashev attacked him. The New York Times quoted an unnamed <kw>law enforcement official</kw> as saying that Todashev had confessed to a triple homicide and implicated <kw>tsarnaev</kw> as well. Todashev\\'s father claims that his son is innocent and that federal investigators are biased against Chechens and made up their case against him. Robel Phillipos, 19, was a U.S. citizen of Ethiopian descent living in Cambridge, was arrested and faced charges of knowingly making false statements to <kw>police</kw>. He graduated from high school in <d>2011</d> with <kw>dzhokhar tsarnaev</kw>. Dias <kw>kadyrbayev</kw>, 19, and <kw>azamat tazhayakov</kw>, 20, were Kazakhstan natives living in the U.S. They were Dzhokhar Tsarnaev\\'s roommates in an off-campus housing complex at which <kw>tsarnaev</kw> had sometimes stayed in New Bedford, <kw>massachusetts</kw>. Phillipos, <kw>kadyrbayev</kw>, <kw>tazhayakov</kw>, and <kw>tsarnaev</kw> entered the University of <kw>massachusetts</kw> Dartmouth in <d>2011-FA</d> and knew each other well. After seeing photos of the as-yet unidentified <kw>tsarnaev</kw> on television, the three men traveled to Tsarnaev\\'s dorm room, where they retrieved a backpack and laptop belonging to <kw>tsarnaev</kw>. The backpack was discarded, but <kw>police</kw> recovered the backpack and contents in a nearby New Bedford landfill on <d>2011-04-26</d>. During interviews, the men initially denied visiting the dorm room but later admitted their actions. During <d>2011-04-18TNI</d>–<d>2011-04-19</d>, <kw>kadyrbayev</kw> and <kw>tazhayakov</kw> were arrested by <kw>police</kw> at the off-campus housing complex. An unidentified girlfriend of one of the men was also arrested. All three were soon released. On <d>2011-04-20</d>, <kw>kadyrbayev</kw> and <kw>tazhayakov</kw> were re-arrested in New Bedford, and held on immigration-related violations. On <d>2011-05-01</d>, they appeared before a federal immigration judge and were charged with overstaying their student visas. <d>2011-05-01</d>, <kw>kadyrbayev</kw> and <kw>tazhayakov</kw> were charged criminally with: willfully conspir(ing) with each other to commit an offense against the United States ... by knowingly destroying, concealing and covering up objects belonging to <kw>dzhokhar tsarnaev</kw>, namely, a backpack containing fireworks and a laptop computer, with the intent to impede, obstruct, and influence the criminal investigation of the <kw>marathon</kw> <kw>bombing</kw>. On <d>2013-08-08</d>, <kw>kadyrbayev</kw> and <kw>tazhayakov</kw> were indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of conspiracy to obstruct justice for helping <kw>dzhokhar tsarnaev</kw> dispose of a laptop computer, fireworks, and a backpack after the <kw>bombing</kw>. Each faced <d>P25Y</d> in prison, and deportation if convicted. On <d>2014-07-21</d>, <kw>tazhayakov</kw> was convicted of obstruction of justice and conspiracy. On <d>2014-08-22</d>, <kw>kadyrbayev</kw> pleaded guilty to obstruction charges. Sentencing was delayed pending the U.S. Supreme Court\\'s ruling in Yates v. United States. In <d>2015-06</d>, <kw>kadyrbayev</kw> was sentenced to <d>P6Y</d> in prison. <kw>tazhayakov</kw> pleaded not guilty and went to trial, arguing that \"<kw>kadyrbayev</kw> was the mastermind behind destroying the evidence and that <kw>tazhayakov</kw> only \\'attempted obstruction.\\'\" Jurors returned a guilty verdict against <kw>tazhayakov</kw>, however, and in <d>2015-06</d>, <kw>tazhayakov</kw> was sentenced to <d>P42M</d> in prison, which equated to three and a half years. Judge Douglas Woodlock gave a lighter sentence to Tazahayakov than to <kw>kadyrbayev</kw>, who was viewed as more culpable. Phillipos was arrested and faced charges of knowingly making false statements to <kw>police</kw>. He was released on $100,000 bail, and placed under house confinement with an ankle bracelet. On <d>2014-10-28</d>, Phillipos was convicted on two charges of lying about being in Tsarnaev\\'s dorm room. He later acknowledged he had been in that room while two other friends removed a backpack containing potential evidence relating to the <kw>bombing</kw>. Phillipos faced a maximum sentence of <d>P8Y</d>\\' imprisonment on each count. In <d>2015-06</d>, U.S. District Judge Douglas P. Woodlock sentenced him to <d>P3Y</d> in prison. Phillipos has filed an appeal. On <d>2014-05-30</d>, a federal indictment against Khairullozhon Matanov was unsealed, charging him with \"one count of destroying, altering, and falsifying records, documents, and tangible objects in a federal investigation, specifically information on his computer, and three counts of making materially false, fictitious, and fraudulent statements in a federal terrorism investigation.\" Matanov bought dinner for the two <kw>tsarnaev</kw> brothers <d>PT40M</d> after the <kw>bombing</kw>. After the <kw>tsarnaev</kw> brothers\\' photos were released to the public, Matanov viewed the photos on the <kw>cnn</kw> and <kw>fbi</kw> websites before attempting to reach Dzhokhar, and then tried to give away his cell phone and delete hundreds of documents from his computer. Prosecutors said that Matanov attempted to mislead investigators about the nature of his relationship with the brothers and to conceal that he shared the brothers\\' philosophy of violence. Matanov was originally from Kyrgyzstan, came to the U.S. in <d>2010</d> on a student visa, and later claimed asylum. He attended Quincy College for <d>P2Y</d> before dropping out to become a taxicab driver. He was living in Quincy, <kw>massachusetts</kw> at the time of his arrest, and was a friend of <kw>tamerlan tsarnaev</kw>. In <d>2015-03</d>, Matanov pleaded guilty to all four counts. In <d>2015-06</d>, he was sentenced to <d>P30M</d> in prison. Three civilians were killed in the <kw>bombing</kw>: Krystle Marie Campbell, 29, a restaurant manager from Medford, <kw>massachusetts</kw>; Lu Lingzi 23, a Chinese national and <kw>boston</kw> University graduate student from Shenyang, Liaoning; and Martin William Richard, an eight-year-old boy from the Dorchester neighborhood of <kw>boston</kw>, who was killed by the second bomb. On <d>2015-04-18</d>, at <d>2015-04-18T22:48</d>, Sean A. Collier, 27, an MIT <kw>police</kw> officer (formerly with the Somerville Auxiliary <kw>police</kw> Department from <d>2006</d> to <d>2009</d>) of Wilmington, <kw>massachusetts</kw>, living in Somerville, <kw>massachusetts</kw>, was ambushed in his <kw>police</kw> car and died from multiple gunshot wounds from the <kw>bombing suspects</kw>. <kw>boston police department</kw> officer Dennis Simmonds died on <d>2014-04-10</d>, as a result of injuries he sustained from a hand grenade at the Watertown shootout. According to the <kw>boston</kw> Public Health Commission, 264 civilians were treated at 27 local hospitals. <d>2014-04-21</d>, 29 remained hospitalized, one in critical condition. Many victims had lower leg injuries and shrapnel wounds, which indicated the devices were low to the ground. At least sixteen civilians lost limbs, at the scene or by amputation in a hospital, and three lost more than one limb. Doctors described removing \"ball-bearing type\" metallic beads a little larger than BBs, and small carpenter-type nails about 1 to 2.5 centimeters (0.4 to 1 in) long. Similar objects were found at the scene. The New York Times cited doctors as saying because the bombs were low to the ground, they mainly injured legs, ankles and feet instead of fatally injuring abdomens, chests, shoulders and heads. Some victims had perforated eardrums. During a firefight with the suspects just after midnight on <d>2014-04-19</d>, 33-year-old MBTA <kw>police</kw> officer Richard H. Donohue Jr. was critically wounded. He lost almost all of his blood, and his heart stopped for <d>PT45M</d>, during which time he was kept alive by cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The <kw>boston</kw> <kw>globe</kw> reported that Donohue may have been accidentally shot by a fellow officer. Marc Fucarile, who lost his right leg and received severe burns and shrapnel wounds, was the last victim released from hospital care, on <d>2013-07-24</d>. <kw>law enforcement</kw>, local and national politicians, and various heads of state reacted quickly to the <kw>bombing</kw>, generally condemning the act and expressing sympathies for the victims. The One Fund <kw>boston</kw>, established by <kw>massachusetts</kw> Governor Deval Patrick and <kw>boston</kw> mayor Thomas Menino and administered by attorney Kenneth Feinberg, expects to make distributions to <kw>bombing</kw> victims by <d>2013-06-30</d>. \"In my <d>P20Y</d> as mayor, I\\'ve never seen the business community come together so quickly,\" said Mayor Menino. <d>P1W</d> after the <kw>bombing</kw>, crowdfunding websites, such as GoFundMe, GiveForward, FundRazr, YouCaring and Fundly, received more than 23,000 pledges promising more than $2 million for the victims, their families, and others affected by the <kw>bombing</kw>. On <d>2013-05-30</d> the <kw>boston</kw> Strong concert at the TD Garden in <kw>boston</kw> benefitted the One Fund. The concert featured Aerosmith, James Taylor, <kw>boston</kw>, J. Geils Band, Dropkick Murphys, New Kids on the Block, Bell Biv DeVoe, Boyz II Men, Jimmy Buffett, Carole King, Extreme, Buffalo Springfield, The Monkees, Neil Young, and Jason Aldean. The Israel Trauma Coalition for Response and Preparedness sent six psychologists and specialists from Israel to help <kw>boston</kw> emergency responder, government administrators, and community stakeholders develop post-terrorist attack recovery strategies. Following a $212,000 donation from Health Bridge Management on <d>2013-09-12</d>, the One Fund <kw>boston</kw> had received more than $69.8 million in donations. As a safety precaution, the NHL postponed a <kw>boston</kw> Bruins home game against the Ottawa Senators at TD Garden scheduled for <d>2013-04-15</d>, to <d>2013-04-28</d> instead. The <kw>boston</kw> Symphony Orchestra canceled its performance of <d>2013-04-15</d>. On <d>2013-04-16</d>, the MBTA public transit system, which was partly shut down, was under heavy National Guard and <kw>police</kw> presence and it was shut down a second time <d>2013-04-19</d> during the manhunt. The NBA\\'s <kw>boston</kw> Celtics game scheduled for <d>2013-04-16</d> against the Indiana Pacers was canceled since both teams\\' playoff seedings were already set. The <kw>boston</kw> Red Sox game at Fenway, the Bruins game, and the Big Apple Circus performance scheduled for <d>2013-04-19</d>, were postponed to support efforts of <kw>law enforcement</kw> officers. The NCAA announced on <d>2013-04-19</d> that the <d>2013</d> NCAA Men\\'s Division III Volleyball Championship, scheduled for <d>2013-04-26</d>–<d>2013-04-28</d> at the MIT campus in Cambridge, would be moved to Nazareth College in the Rochester, New York area. In the days after the <kw>bombing</kw>, makeshift memorials began to <d>2013-SP</d> up all along the cordoned off area surrounding <kw>boylston street</kw>. The largest was initially located on Arlington Street, the easternmost edge of the barricades. Starting with flowers, tokens and T-shirts, the makeshift memorial at Arlington Street quickly expanded prior to the move of the easternmost edge of the barricade westward from Arlington Street to Berkeley Street, as well as the move of the memorial from Arlington Street to Berkeley Street. The growth of the memorial at Berkeley Street was rapid over the proceeding days starting with a small pile of assorted mementos on <d>2013-04-17</d>, and growing to a substantial shrine on <d>2013-04-18</d>. By <d>2013-04-19</d>, the memorial was beginning to swell outwards toward Berkeley Street itself. With the reopening of <kw>copley square</kw> to the Public, the memorials along the boundaries of <kw>boylston street</kw>, including the largest one at Berkeley Street, were consolidated and moved into <kw>copley square</kw>. In <d>2013-06</d> the Makeshift Memorial located in <kw>copley square</kw> was taken down and the memorial objects located there were moved to the archives in West Roxbury for cleaning, fumigation, and archiving. <kw>boston</kw> University established a scholarship in honor of Lü Lingzi, a student who died in the <kw>bombing</kw>. MIT also established a scholarship and erected a sculpture (unveiled on <d>2015-04-29</d>), both in memory of MIT <kw>police</kw> officer Sean Collier. On <d>2013-04-26</d>, the Celtics honored the <kw>bombing</kw> victims and first responders before their playoff game against the Knicks at home in the TD Garden. The Bruins\\' home playoff games held tributes to the <kw>marathon</kw> <kw>bombing</kw> victims and first responders before the opening face-off. After the Chicago Blackhawks defeated the Bruins in the <d>2013</d> Stanley Cup Finals, the Blackhawks took out a full-page ad in the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>globe</kw> thanking the city of <kw>boston</kw> for respect and sportsmanship during the Cup Finals and praising their recovery from the <kw>bombing</kw>. On <d>2013-09-12</d>, the New England Patriots honored 25 first responders with special jerseys in a ceremony before their opening home game against the New York Jets at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough. After the Red Sox won the <d>2013</d> World Series, the team used their celebratory parade on <d>2013-11-02</d>, to honor the victims of the <kw>bombing</kw> at a dedication on the <kw>marathon</kw> <kw>finish line</kw>, a move considered to help the city \"reclaim\" its spirit that was lost after the <kw>bombing</kw>. A couple, Christian Williams and Caroline Reinsch, who both had sustained injuries in the <kw>bombing</kw>, and who had <kw>learned</kw> they were expecting while in hospital, had a daughter on <d>2013-12-18</d>. President Barack Obama addressed the nation after the attack. He said that, although the perpetrator(s) were still unknown, the government would \"get to the bottom of this\" and that those responsible \"will feel the full weight of justice\". The President addressed the American <kw>people</kw> <d>2013-12-19</d>, and later said, \"Any time bombs are used to target innocent civilians, it is an act of terror.\" President Obama ordered flags to half-staff until <d>2013-04-20</d> on all federal buildings as \"a mark of respect for the victims of the senseless acts of violence perpetrated on <d>2013-04-15</d>, in <kw>boston</kw>, <kw>massachusetts</kw>.\" On <d>2013-04-18</d>, President Obama addressed an interfaith service at the Cathedral of the Holy Cross in <kw>boston</kw> to honor the victims of the <kw>attacks</kw>. Moments of silence were held at various events across the country, including at the openings of the New York Stock Exchange, NASDAQ, and NYMEX on the day after the <kw>bombing</kw>. A <kw>boston</kw> Remembrance Run held in Portland, Oregon, on <d>2013-04-17</d>, drew over 1,000 runners in a silent show of support. The Oklahoma City Memorial <kw>marathon</kw> organizers asked runners, volunteers, and spectators to wear red socks. <kw>marathon</kw> organizer Andrea Miles said, \"As Oklahomans and folks participating in the OKC Memorial <kw>marathon</kw>, we have such a deep connection to not only the <kw>marathon</kw> but the events from the Murrah <kw>bombing</kw> that have led to this memorial,\" Miles said. \"So <d>PRESENT_REF</d> we\\'re not just running to remember the 168 <kw>people</kw> who were lost in <d>1995</d> but also to honor <kw>boston</kw> and stand in solidarity with them.\". The <kw>marathon</kw> in Lansing, MI was the first <kw>marathon</kw> ran in the United States after the <kw>bombing</kw>. The events featured a moment of silence led by Mayor Virg Benero in respect for those affected by the incidents in <kw>boston</kw>. This was preceded by Benero joining a Michigan resident who, after stopping short of the finish in <kw>boston</kw> due to the <kw>bombing</kw>, finished the remaining half-mile of the race in Lansing. On <d>2013-06-07</d>, a cross-country relay, One Run for <kw>boston</kw>, left Venice Beach, Los Angeles, California, for <kw>boston</kw>. Organized by three Britons—Danny Bent, Kate Treleaven and James Hay—to support the <kw>boston</kw> One Fund, the relay included more than 2,000 runners in 319 stages of 5 to 12 miles for a total of more than 3,000 miles in 14 states. The GPS baton carried to track the relay\\'s progress crossed the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> <kw>finish line</kw> <d>2013-06-07T01:00</d> on <d>2013-07-01</d>. The <kw>bombing</kw> was denounced and condolences were offered by many international leaders as well as leading figures from international sport. Security measures were increased worldwide in the wake of the attack. In China, users posted condolence messages on Weibo in response to the death of Lü Lingzi. Chris Buckley of The New York Times said \"Ms. Lu\\'s death gave a melancholy face to the attraction that America and its colleges exert over many young Chinese.\" Laurie Burkitt of The Wall Street Journal said \"Ms. Lu\\'s death resonates with many in China\" due to the one-child policy. Organizers of the London <kw>marathon</kw>, which was held <d>P6D</d> after the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>bombing</kw>, reviewed security arrangements for their event, despite there not being any threat against it. Hundreds of extra <kw>police</kw> officers were drafted in to provide a greater presence on the streets, but despite the security concerns a record 700,000 spectators lined the streets. Runners in London observed a <d>PT30S</d> silence in respect for the victims of <kw>boston</kw> shortly before the race began, and many runners wore black ribbons on their vests. Organisers also pledged to donate US$3 to a fund for <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> victims for every person who finished the race. Organizers of the <d>2013</d> Vancouver Sun Run, which was held on <d>2013-04-21</d>, donated $10 from every late entry for the race to help victims of the <kw>bombing</kw> at the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw>. Jamie Pitblado, vice-president of promotions for The Vancouver Sun and The Province, said the money would go to One Fund <kw>boston</kw>, an official charity that\\'s collecting donations for the victims and their families. Sun Run organizers raised anywhere from $25,000 to $40,000. There were over 48,000 participants, many dressed in blue and yellow (<kw>boston</kw> colors) with others wearing <kw>boston</kw> Red Sox caps. Petr Gandalovic, ambassador of the Czech Republic, released a statement after noticing much confusion on Facebook and Twitter between his nation and the Chechen Republic. \"The Czech Republic and Chechnya are two very different entities – the Czech Republic is a Central European country; Chechnya is a part of the Russian Federation.\" Security was also stepped up in Singapore in response to online threats made on attacking several locations in the city-state and the Singapore <kw>marathon</kw> in <d>2013-12</d>. Two suspects were investigated and one was eventually arrested for making false bomb threats. The Russian government said special attention would be paid to security at upcoming international sports events in Russia, including the <d>2014</d> <d>2014-WI</d> Olympics. According to the Russian embassy in the U.S., President Vladimir Putin condemned the <kw>bombing</kw> as a \"barbaric crime\" and \"stressed that the Russian Federation will be ready, if necessary, to assist in the U.S. authorities\\' investigation.\" He urged closer cooperation of security services with Western partners. Republican U.S. Senators Saxby Chambliss and Richard Burr reported that Russian authorities had separately asked both the <kw>fbi</kw> (at least twice: during <d>2011-03</d> and <d>2011-11</d>) and the CIA (<d>2011-09</d>) to look carefully into <kw>tamerlan tsarnaev</kw> and provide more information about him back to Russia. Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) secretly recorded phone conversations between <kw>tamerlan tsarnaev</kw> and his mother Zubeidat Tsarnaeva (they vaguely and indirectly discussed jihad) and sent these to the <kw>fbi</kw> as evidence of possible extremist links within the family. However, while Russia offered US intelligence services warnings that <kw>tsarnaev</kw> planned to link up with extremist groups abroad, an <kw>fbi</kw> investigation yielded no evidence to support those claims at the time. In addition, subsequent U.S. requests for additional information about <kw>tsarnaev</kw> went unanswered by the Russians. But Russian authorities and mass media blame U.S. authorities for negligence because the authorities were warned by Russian counterparts several times long before the <kw>bombing</kw> happened. Moreover Russian authorities and mass media since <d>2014-SP</d> blame USA for politically motivated false information about lack of response from Russian authorities after subsequent U.S. requests. As a proof a letter from Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) were shown to the members of U.S. Congressmen official delegation to Moscow during their visit. This letter with information about <kw>tsarnaev</kw> (including his biography details, connections and phone number) had been sent from FSB to <kw>fbi</kw> and CIA during <d>2011-03</d>. On <d>2013-04-19</d>, the press-secretary of the head of the Chechen Republic, Ramzan Kadyrov, issued a statement that, inter alia, read: \"The <kw>boston</kw> <kw>bombing suspects</kw> have nothing to do with Chechnya\". On <d>2013-04-19</d>, Kadyrov was reported by The Guardian to have written on Instagram: Any attempt to make a link between Chechnya and the Tsarnaevs, if they are guilty, is in vain. They grew up in the U.S., their views and beliefs were formed there. The roots of evil must be searched for in America. The whole world must battle with terrorism. We know this better than anyone. We wish recover to all the victims and share Americans\\' feeling of sorrow. Akhmed Zakayev, head of the secular wing of the Chechen separatist movement, <d>PRESENT_REF</d> in exile in London, condemned the <kw>bombing</kw> as \"terrorist\" and expressed condolences to the families of the victims. Zakayev denied that the bombers were in any way representative of the Chechen <kw>people</kw>, saying that \"the Chechen <kw>people</kw> never had and can not have any hostile feelings toward the United States and its citizens.\" The Mujahideen of the Caucasus Emirate Province of Dagestan, the Caucasian Islamist organization in both Chechnya and Dagestan, denied any link to the <kw>bombing</kw> or the <kw>tsarnaev</kw> brothers and stated that it was at war with Russia, not the United States. It also said that it had sworn off violence against civilians since <d>2012</d>. In the Turkistan Islamic Party\\'s Turkestan Al-Islamiyya magazine, Issue 13, the Rohingya cleric Abu Dhar \\'Azzam (Abu Dhar Al-Burmi) congratulated the <kw>tsarnaev</kw> brothers on their terrorist attack in the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> <kw>bombing</kw>, saying In the very house of unbelief, two Chechen brothers destroyed the infidels\\' fortresses on <d>2013-04-16</d>. During the [ensuing] search [by the authorities for the perpetrators], the elder brother died as a martyr in the field of glory and honor, Allah willing. The younger brother, Dzokhar, remained, and told his dear nation: \\'We did this operation as revenge for what America does in Palestine, Iraq, and Afghanistan.\\' He didn\\'t mention his homeland Chechnya, since this jihad is a jihad of [an entire] nation, not [a campaign] for the liberation of a single land.... The Muslims\\' lands are one and their honor is one. During the manhunt for the perpetrators of the <kw>bombing</kw>, Governor Deval Patrick said \"we are asking <kw>people</kw> to shelter in place.\" The request was highly effective; most <kw>people</kw> stayed home, causing <kw>boston</kw>, Watertown, and Cambridge to come to a virtual standstill. According to Time magazine, \"media described residents complying with a \\'lockdown order,\\' but in reality the governor\\'s security measure was a request. Scott Silliman, emeritus director of the Center on Law, Ethics and National Security at Duke Law School, said that the shelter-in-place request was voluntary. The shelter-in-place directive was criticized by some commentators. Michael Cohen of The Observer said that Americans have little experience with daily terrorism compared to some countries and \"are more primed to … assume the absolute worst.\" Cohen wrote that it was not the first time dangerous murderers have been on the loose in a large American city (citing Christopher Dorner in <d>2013</d> and the Beltway sniper <kw>attacks</kw> in <d>2002</d>), but noted that \"lockdown\" measures were not used in those cases. Former congressman and presidential candidate Ron Paul, criticized what he described as a \"military-style takeover of parts of <kw>boston</kw>\" during the investigation and wrote that \"this unprecedented move should frighten us as much or more than the attack itself.\" Haaretz\\'s Chemi Salev wrote that \"in terms of cost-benefit analysis, from the evil terrorist\\'s point of view, the <kw>boylston street</kw> <kw>bombings</kw> and their aftermath can only be viewed as a resounding triumph\" since the \"relatively amateurish\" terrorists managed to intimidate a vast number of <kw>people</kw> and got a maximum amount of publicity. Responding to Salev in the New York Times, Ross Douthat commented that the massive manhunt operation might deter other amateur terrorists, but not hard-core terrorists such as Mohammed Atta. Douthat argued that out-of-the-ordinary measures can only be used when terrorism itself is out-of-the-ordinary: if <kw>attacks</kw> started to occur more often, <kw>people</kw> would not be as willing to comply with shelter-in-place commands, yet once a terrorist has been hunted with such an operation, it is hard to justify why such measures should not be taken the next time. On the afternoon of the <kw>bombing</kw>, The New York Post reported that a suspect, a Saudi Arabian male, was under guard and being questioned at a <kw>boston</kw> hospital. That evening, <kw>boston</kw> <kw>police</kw> Commissioner Ed <kw>davis</kw> said that there had not been an arrest. The Post did not retract its story about the suspect, leading to widespread reports by CBS News, <kw>cnn</kw>, and other media that a Middle Eastern suspect was in custody. The day after the <kw>bombing</kw>, a majority of outlets were reporting that the Saudi was a witness, not a suspect. The New York Post on its <d>2002-04-18</d> front page showed two men, and said they were being sought by the authorities. The two were not the ones being sought as suspects. They were a 17-year-old boy and his track coach. The boy, from Revere, <kw>massachusetts</kw>, turned himself over to the <kw>police</kw> immediately and was cleared after a <d>PT20M</d> interview in which they advised him to deactivate his Facebook account. New York Post editor Col Allan stated, \"We stand by our story. The image was emailed to <kw>law enforcement</kw> agencies <d>2002-04-17TAF</d> seeking information about these men, as our story reported. We did not identify them as suspects.\" The two were implied to be possible suspects via crowdsourcing on the websites Reddit and 4chan Several other <kw>people</kw> were mistakenly identified as suspects. Two of those wrongly identified as suspects on Reddit were a 17-year-old track star and Sunil Tripathi, a Brown University student missing since <d>2002-03</d>. Tripathi was found dead on <d>2002-04-23</d> in the Providence River. On <d>2002-04-17</d>, the <kw>fbi</kw> released the following statement: Contrary to widespread reporting, no arrest has been made in connection with the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> attack. Over <d>2002-04-16</d> and a half, there have been a number of press reports based on information from unofficial sources that has been inaccurate. Since these stories often have unintended consequences, we ask the media, particularly at this early stage of the investigation, to exercise caution and attempt to verify information through appropriate official channels before reporting. The decision to release the photos of the <kw>tsarnaev</kw> brothers was made in part to limit damage done to those misidentified on the Internet and by the media, and to address concerns over maintaining control of the manhunt. <d>2010</d> Times Square car <kw>bombing</kw> attempt, attempted <kw>bombing</kw> in New York City using a pressure cooker bomb and other explosive devices <d>2011</d> Waltham triple murder, a triple homicide to which <kw>tamerlan tsarnaev</kw> has been connected <d>2013</d> Bat Yam bus <kw>bombing</kw>, <kw>bombing</kw> of a public bus in Israel using a pressure cooker bomb Centennial Olympic Park <kw>bombing</kw>, a <d>1996</d> terrorist attack also targeting a public event External images Wikimedia Commons has <kw>media related</kw> to <d>2013</d> <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon bombings</kw>.',\n",

Hospitals reported at least 144 <kw>people</kw> are being treated, with at least 17 of them in critical condition and 25 in serious condition. At least eight of the patients are children. Several of the patients treated at <kw>massachusetts</kw> General Hospital suffered injuries to lower limbs that will require \"serial operations\" in the <d>FUTURE_REF</d>, trauma surgeon Peter Fagenholz said <d>XXXX-XX-XXTNI</d>. Some injuries were so severe amputations were necessary, Fagenholz added. <kw>boston</kw> \"is a tough and resilient town,\" he said, adding that Americans will stand by Bostonians \"every single step of the way.\" The terrorist attack, near the marathon\\'s <kw>finish line</kw>, triggered widespread screaming and chaos, shattered windows and barricades and sent smoke billowing into the air at <kw>copley square</kw>. The blasts were about 50 to 100 yards apart, <kw>officials</kw> said, on a stretch of the <kw>marathon</kw> course lined with spectators cheering runners through the final yards of a 26-mile, 385-yard endurance feat. Allan Panter, a doctor who was near the <kw>finish line</kw> waiting for his wife to finish the race, <kw>told cnn</kw> he was standing about 20 to 25 feet from the first blast. He said he treated victims on the street after the explosion. \"I saw at least six to seven <kw>people</kw> down next to me,\" he said. \"They protected me from the blast. One lady expired. One gentleman lost both his (lower) limbs. Most of the injuries were lower extremities.\" Bill Iffrig, 78 and a veteran marathoner, was nearing the finish when \"the shock waves just hit my whole body and my legs just started jittering around.\" Iffrig, who can be seen in <kw>video</kw> of the explosion wearing an orange tank top, was helped to his feet by an event volunteer and had just a scratch from his fall, he <kw>told cnn</kw>. <kw>federal authorities</kw> are classifying the <kw>bombings</kw> as a terrorist attack, but it\\'s not clear whether the origin was domestic or foreign, a federal <kw>law enforcement official</kw> with knowledge of the investigation said. A federal <kw>law enforcement official</kw> <kw>told cnn</kw> that both bombs were small, and initial tests showed no C-4 or other high-grade explosive material, suggesting that the <kw>packages</kw> used in the attack were crude explosive devices. One unexploded device was found at a hotel on <kw>boylston street</kw> near the bomb site and another unexploded device was found at an undisclosed location, Keating, a Democrat and member of the House Homeland Security Committee, said. He called the <kw>bombing</kw> a \"sophisticated, coordinated, planned attack.\" It was unclear who may have planted the <kw>marathon</kw> bombs. There were no credible threats before the race, a state government official said. Investigators warned <kw>police</kw> to be on the lookout for a \"darker-skinned or black male\" with a possible foreign accent in connection with the attack, according to a <kw>law enforcement</kw> advisory obtained by <kw>cnn</kw>. The man was seen with a black backpack and sweatshirt and was trying to get into a restricted area <d>PT5M</d> before the first explosion, the lookout notice states. Also, a Saudi national with a leg wound was under guard at a <kw>boston</kw> hospital in connection with the <kw>bombings</kw>, but investigators cannot say he is involved at this time and he is not in custody, a <kw>law enforcement official</kw> said <d>XXXX-XX-XXTEV</d>. In addition to scrutinizing images of surveillance cameras in the area, the <kw>fbi</kw> likely was issuing subpoenas for records from cell towers in the area to isolate and trace calls from around <kw>copley square</kw> at the time of the blasts, according to a former federal <kw>law enforcement official</kw> who <d>PRESENT_REF</d> works in the intelligence community. The unexploded devices that were recovered could provide a treasure trove of information such as fingerprints and indications of the bomb maker\\'s design, and from the bombs that did explode, investigators would be looking for fragments and anything indicating the \"signature\" of the bomb makers, the <kw>official told cnn</kw>. As authorities searched the scene, numerous <kw>suspicious packages</kw> were found, possibly because <kw>people</kw> fled the area, leaving items behind. Investigators were checking them. \"My thoughts and prayers are with those who have been injured. I have been in touch with the president, Mayor (Thomas) Menino and our public safety leaders. Our focus is on making sure that the area around <kw>copley square</kw> is safe and secured. I am asking everyone to stay away from <kw>copley square</kw> and let the first responders do their jobs.\" Holder has directed the full resources of the Justice Department to be deployed to ensure the matter is fully investigated, the official said. Other cities, including New York and Washington, tightened security as a result. Following standard protocol, the White House cleared out an area in front of the West Wing. Mike Baingon, who works at the Atlantic Fish Company in <kw>boston</kw>, said an explosion took place in front of the restaurant and that he was right by the front door at the time. The <kw>explosions</kw> occurred at <d>XXXX-XX-XXT14:45</d>, <d>PT2H</d> after the first of the race\\'s nearly 27,000 runners had crossed the <kw>finish line</kw>, <kw>cnn</kw> Producer Matt Frucci reported.

       " 6: 'Claim: Rumors and conspiracy theories associated with the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> <kw>bombing</kw>. Origins: As is common after disasters in the Internet age (e.g., the 9/11 <kw>attacks</kw>, Hurricane Katrina, the <kw>sandy hook</kw> shooting), the online word is abuzz with a variety of rumors and conspiracy theories related to that event. Below we attempt to chart some of the most prevalent items associated with the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon bombings</kw> of <d>2013-04-15</d>: <kw>fbi</kw> Previous Investigation of <kw>tamerlan tsarnaev</kw> On <d>2013-04-19</d>, the <kw>fbi</kw> confirmed that it had previously investigated the background of <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> <kw>bombing</kw> suspect <kw>tamerlan tsarnaev</kw>, stating in a press release that: The two individuals believed to be responsible for the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon bombings</kw> have been positively identified as <kw>tamerlan tsarnaev</kw>, <d>PRESENT_REF</d> deceased, and Dzhokar <kw>tsarnaev</kw>, <d>PRESENT_REF</d> in custody. These individuals are brothers and residents of <kw>massachusetts</kw>. <kw>tamerlan tsarnaev</kw> was a legal permanent resident and Dzhokar <kw>tsarnaev</kw> is a naturalized U.S. citizen. Once the <kw>fbi</kw> <kw>learned</kw> the identities of the two brothers, the <kw>fbi</kw> reviewed its records and determined that in <d>2011</d>, a foreign government asked the <kw>fbi</kw> for information about <kw>tamerlan tsarnaev</kw>. The request stated that it was based on information that he was a follower of <kw>radical islam</kw> and a strong believer, and that he had changed drastically since <d>2010</d> as he prepared to leave the United States for travel to the country\\'s region to join unspecified underground groups. In response to this <d>2011</d> request, the <kw>fbi</kw> checked U.S. government databases and other information to look for such things as derogatory telephone communications, possible use of online sites associated with the promotion of radical activity, associations with other persons of interest, travel history and plans, and education history. The <kw>fbi</kw> also interviewed <kw>tamerlan tsarnaev</kw> and family members. The <kw>fbi</kw> did not find any terrorism activity, domestic or foreign, and those results were provided to the foreign government in <d>2011-SU</d>. The <kw>fbi</kw> requested but did not receive more specific or additional information from the foreign government. Suspects Became Citizens on 9/11 One rumor posited the irony that the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> <kw>bombing suspects</kw>, brothers Tamerlan and Dzhokar <kw>tsarnaev</kw> (originally from the Russian republic of Kyrgyzstan or Chechnya) had become naturalized citizens of the U.S. on <d>2011-09-11</d>, the anniversary of the 2001 terrorist <kw>attacks</kw> on the <kw>world trade center</kw> and Pentagon. According to news accounts, Dzhokar came to America on <d>2002-07-01</d> as a tourist, asked for asylum, and was naturalized as a U.S. citizen on <d>2012-09-11</d>. However, his older brother Tamerlan came to the U.S. later; although Tamerlan eventually acquired permanent residency status, he did not obtain U.S. citizenship. \\'Coexist\\' Bumper Sticker Over <d>2012-04-18TNI</d>-<d>2012-04-19</d>, the two suspects in the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon bombings</kw>, Tamerlan and Dzhokar <kw>tsarnaev</kw>, reportedly fatally shot an MIT <kw>police</kw> officer in Cambridge, carjacked a Mercedes SUV, led <kw>police</kw> on a car chase into Watertown, and engaged in a firefight that ended with Tamerlan being shot dead. His younger brother Dzhokar eventually abandoned the stolen vehicle and fled on foot; he was captured that evening after being discovered hiding in a boat parked behind a house. Rumor later claimed that the vehicle the <kw>tsarnaev</kw> brothers carjacked bore a \\'Coexist\\' bumper sticker, a claim based on the following screen capture from a television news report: However, the vehicle shown in that image does not appear to match the Mercedes SUV that other news accounts described and pictured as the one carjacked by the <kw>tsarnaev</kw> brothers: Pressure Cooker Ad On <d>2013-04-18</d>, both the print and digital versions of the Minneapolis Star Tribune inadvertently ran a Macy\\'s advertisement for pressure cookers adjacent to a story about citizens helping victims wounded in the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon bombings</kw>, something of a faux pas because it is believed that the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>bombings</kw> were carried out using pressure cookers packed with explosives: Westboro Baptist Church The Westboro Baptist Church (WBC), of Topeka, Kansas, is headed by pastor Fred Phelps. WBC is widely known for its anti-homosexual stance, and members of its congregation have drawn much publicity by staging anti-gay protests and picketing at the funerals of military members and celebrities. (At such funerals, WBC members typically portray the deceased\\'s passing as God\\'s punishment for America\\'s tolerance of homosexuality.) As they did after the <kw>sandy hook</kw> shootings, the WBC has announced an intention to picket the funerals of those killed in the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon bombings</kw> in the sense that they stated so in a Twitter announcement on the afternoon of the <kw>bombings</kw>: However, although the Westboro Baptist Church had said they planned to picket the funeral of <kw>sandy hook</kw> principal Dawn Hochsprung, motorcyclists lined up at the site of the service that day to confront the WBC\\'s protesters, and the latter never did materialize. Supporters of the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> victims are hoping the WBC will be no-shows at the funerals of those killed in that tragedy as well. Suspect/Backpack Photos A pair of circulated photographs purportedly show a black backpack from the scene of the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon bombings</kw> and a man in the crowd at the <kw>marathon</kw> (who is said to be wanted by <kw>police</kw>) wearing a blue jacket and carrying what looks like that backpack: According to news accounts, the former picture was included in a security bulletin issued to <kw>law enforcement</kw> agencies by the <kw>fbi</kw> and shows a shredded backpack in which one of the bombs was hidden. The latter picture was not one that was distributed by <kw>police</kw> for help in locating a suspect; rather, it is the product of various individuals on the Internet scouring photos of the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> scene for clues and circulating their speculations online. . On <d>2013-04-18</d>, <d>2013-04-18</d>, the <kw>fbi</kw> released photographs of two suspects they were seeking additional information about, neither of whom was the man pictured above: On <d>2013-04-19</d>, one of the suspects was killed in a shootout with <kw>police</kw>, and the second was apprehended later <d>2013-04-19</d> in Watertown, <kw>massachusetts</kw>. \"Early Creation\" Facebook Pages As occurred after the <kw>sandy hook</kw> shooting, conspiracy proponents claimed that a number of the Facebook <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> bombing-related pages of the type which inevitably <d>2013-SP</d> up in the aftermath of such tragedies (e.g., memorials, tributes, condolences, and donation sites for victims) bear dates indicating they were created earlier than the occurrence of the events they reference, thus exposing those tragedies as \"false flag\" events planned and coordinated by some sinister force (usually said to be the government) intent on deflecting blame away from the \"real\" perpetrators. After the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> <kw>bombing</kw>, one page titled \"Our thoughts and prayers go out to all involved in the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>bombings</kw>\" was flagged as such because it was allegedly created <d>PTXH</d> prior to the <kw>bombings</kw>, and another (since removed) page with the title \"Thoughts go out to all involved in the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>explosions</kw>\" was similarly identified as suspicious because it bore a \"Joined Facebook\" date of <d>2013-04-13</d> (<d>P2D</d> before the <kw>bombings</kw> it references). However, as we discuss in another article, the dates shown on Facebook pages are not reliable indicators of their dates of creation. The date indicating when the entity associated with the page was Born, Founded, Started, Created, Opened, or Launched is a user-selectable value that can be set to anything the page creator wishes to choose. (Hence our own snopes.com Facebook page bears the legend \"Launched in <d>1994</d>,\" because that\\'s when we first began publishing material about urban legends on the web.) Likewise, \"Joined Facebook\" dates by themselves do not provide reliable timelines documenting the creation dates of Facebook pages. Facebook page names can be changed, and pages which were initially created prior to particular events for other reasons and then renamed/repurposed after those events retain their original pre-tragedy dates. So, an unused Facebook page created in <d>2013-03</d> can be quickly renamed to serve as a memorial for victims who died in an <d>2013-04</d> <kw>bombing</kw>, but the \"Joined Facebook\" date will reflect the earlier (<d>2013-03</d>) date. <kw>sandy hook</kw> Child Killed in <kw>bombing</kw> One prominent rumor claimed that one of the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> <kw>bombing</kw> victims was an 8-year-old girl who attended school at <kw>sandy hook</kw> and/or was running the <kw>marathon</kw> for the victims of the <kw>sandy hook</kw> shootings. Some iterations of the rumor included a photograph of the purported victim: This rumor is false: the child killed in the <kw>bombings</kw> was not a participant in the race, and children are not allowed on the course. As reported in the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>globe</kw>, the young victim was Martin Richard, an 8-year-old boy who was killed as he waited near the <kw>finish line</kw> with his parents and siblings: Grief-stricken neighbors <d>PRESENT_REF</d> described Martin Richard, the 8-year-old Dorchester boy killed when two bombs detonated at the <kw>finish line</kw> of the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> , as a child full of life who was part of a very close-knit family. “They were always together,\" neighbor Jane Sherman said of the Richard family, who live next door to her on Carruth Street in Dorchester. \"This is the worst tragedy I have ever been through in my life. It’s a horrific situation.\" The boy was killed and his mother and his younger sister gravely wounded as they waited at the <kw>boylston street</kw> <kw>finish line</kw>. The picture of the girl is completely unrelated to the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon bombings</kw>; it\\'s a photograph taken from another race (the 3rd Annual Joe Cassella 5K) run in Virginia back in <d>2012-05</d>. Martin Richard Photo After Martin Richard was identified as the 8-year-old child who had been killed by one of the <kw>explosions</kw>, a photograph was circulated showing a boy holding up a sign decorated with hearts and a peace sign and bearing the legend \"No more hurting <kw>people</kw>. Peace.\" This photo was said to be a picture of Martin Richard: This is Martin, 8. He died in the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>bombing</kw> <d>2013-04-12</d>. He was at the <kw>finish line</kw> with his family, waiting for his dad to cross. His mother and little sister were catastrophically injured. He was the student of our dear friend, Rachel Moo. His message resonates powerfully <d>PRESENT_REF</d>. My prayer is that we all live by Martin\\'s words, paying tribute to his too-brief, but immeasurably valuable life by following his example. This is indeed a picture of Martin Richard, taken in <d>2012-04</d> during a classroom lesson on the shooting of Trayvon Martin. A photo gallery published by the New York Post includes this image along with other photographs of Martin Richard and pictures of well-wishers visiting the Richard\\'s home to leave messages, flowers, and other tokens of support. Woman Killed Before Boyfriend\\'s Proposal One circulated photograph reportedly showed a man in a posture of anguish after learning that his girlfriend, whom he planned to propose to after she completed running the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw>, had been killed in the <kw>bombings</kw>: The man in the red shirt planned to propose to his girlfriend as she crossed the <kw>finish line</kw> at the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw>, but she passed away. Most of us will never experience this amount of emotional pain. Occurrences like this remind us how fragile life is and how important each person is to so many <kw>people</kw>. My heart goes out to all of the <kw>people</kw> affected. According to news accounts, this photograph shows a man attempting to render aid to Sydney Corcoran, an 18-year-old high school student whose legs were shredded by shrapnel from one of the bombs. The so far unidentified man in the red shirt has been described as a \"stranger\" and not her boyfriend, and Sydney Corcoran was not a participant in the race (nor was she killed by the explosion that injured her): Shrapnel from one of the bombs that exploded during the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> shredded both of Sydney\\'s legs, leaving her with deep arterial injuries, said her older brother, Tyler Corcoran, during an interview in the kitchen of the family\\'s home in the city\\'s Pawtucketville neighborhood. Sydney, with her mother, Celeste, and father Kevin, were in <kw>boston</kw> to watch her aunt, Carmen Accabo, of Westford, finish the storied event. Celeste, too, was struck by shrapnel and overnight had both legs amputated below the knee, Tyler said. Kevin received minor injuries, but otherwise was physically okay. He was at the <kw>boston</kw> Medical Center bedsides of both his wife and daughter <d>2013-04-09</d>, said his brother, Tim Corcoran, of Rhode Island. The picture [of her being aided by a stranger] in a red t-shirt was so touching that it sparked a false rumor on Twitter that he was proposing to his dying girlfriend. <kw>boston</kw> <kw>globe</kw> Tweet On <d>2013-04-15TAF</d>, the Twitter feed of the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>globe</kw> reported that <kw>officials</kw> had stated \"There will be a controlled explosion opposite the library within <d>PT1M</d> as part of bomb squad activities\": This tweet was proffered by conspiracy theorists as proof that <kw>officials</kw> planned for a \"controlled explosion\" to be under way at the same time as the <kw>marathon</kw> <kw>explosions</kw>, a highly suspect \"coincidence\" that indicated the <kw>bombings</kw> were \"false flag\" operation. However, this tweet was issued <d>PT1H</d> after the bomb blasts and referenced a controlled detonation of a suspicious device near the central branch of the <kw>boston</kw> Public Library, which is on the stretch of <kw>boylston street</kw> where the initial <kw>explosions</kw> occurred. A fire coincidentally broke out at the JFK Presidential Library and Museum at about the same time as the <kw>explosions</kw>, and as a precaution <kw>police</kw> were summoned to the scene while bomb squads swept the building for explosive devices: A fire and possible explosion <d>2013-04-15TAF</d> at the JFK Presidential Library and Museum prompted a full-scale investigation by local, state, and <kw>federal authorities</kw> to determine whether the incidents were linked to the deadly <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> blasts. The fire broke out shortly before <d>2013-04-15T15:00</d> — around the same time as the <kw>marathon</kw> <kw>explosions</kw> several miles away — in an HVAC system in a section of the complex opened in <d>2011</d> that houses offices, a classroom, and some archival material, said Rachel Flor, a library spokeswoman. Everyone evacuated the building in Dorchester safely and no injuries were reported, she said. Thomas Putnam, the library’s director, told reporters <d>2013-04-15T16:00</d> that a bomb squad was coming in as a precautionary measure in light of the <kw>marathon</kw> blasts. Shortly afterward, <kw>boston</kw> <kw>police</kw> and State <kw>police</kw> cars swarmed the library parking lot, along with authorities from the US Secret Service and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. They ordered all employees and visitors off the property, as they conducted a full sweep for bombs. False Victim As happened with the <kw>sandy hook</kw> shooting, conspiracy buffs have circulated images claiming that persons associated with the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> <kw>bombing</kw> are not who they claim to be, but rather \"actors\" or \"plants\" employed to pull off a staged event. One such image stated that a news photograph showing a <kw>bombing</kw> victim who suffered a serious leg injury in one of the <kw>explosions</kw> actually pictured Nick Vogt, a U.S. Army lieutenant who lost both his legs to an IED explosion in Afghanistan in <d>2011-11</d>: However, the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> <kw>bombing</kw> victim pictured in the upper left-hand quadrant of this image was identified on Facebook as Jeff Bauman Jr., of Chelmsford, <kw>massachusetts</kw>, by his father, Jeff Bauman Sr.: \"Can everyone pray for my son Jeff Jr.?\" Jeff Bauman Sr. wrote in an emotional plea on his Facebook page hours after the <kw>bombings</kw> at the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw>. The elder Bauman, of Chelmsford, posted that message under a news photo of his critically injured son being rushed from the scene, after two <kw>explosions</kw> near the <kw>finish line</kw> killed three and injured more than 140. Bauman, who could not be reached for comment, wrote that his son was at the <kw>finish line</kw> when he was injured by one of the blasts. His son was transported to a hospital where he was undergoing surgery on his legs. \"I just can\\'t explain what\\'s wrong with <kw>people</kw> <d>PRESENT_REF</d> to do this to <kw>people</kw>,\" Bauman posted. \"I\\'m really starting to lose faith in our country.\" From his hospital room, Jeff Bauman Jr. provided the <kw>fbi</kw> with a description of a man whom he saw drop a bag near the <kw>finish line</kw> of the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw>, information which may have helped <kw>law enforcement</kw> identify one of the suspects. <kw>sandy hook</kw> Principal Another image purportedly demonstrated a connection between the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> <kw>bombing</kw> and the <kw>sandy hook</kw> shooting: Whoa! Government is slipping up! This lady supposedly died in the elementary school shooting & apparently died again in the <kw>bombing</kw> at <kw>boston</kw>. They have to be smarter than this, right? The woman pictured above is the late Dawn Lafferty Hochsprung, the school principal who was killed in the <kw>sandy hook</kw> shootings, and the right-hand panel purportedly shows her picture being displayed on the screen during an interview with someone named Donna about the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon bombings</kw>. Some commentators have noted that the woman who stepped in as principal at <kw>sandy hook</kw> after Dawn Hochsprung\\'s death was Donna Page and theorized that the former was the \"Donna\" referenced during the pictured interview about the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon bombings</kw> (in the course of which her predecessor\\'s picture was shown on-screen). Although at least one woman named Donna who ran in the <kw>marathon</kw> that day did give media interviews about her experience, the only such reference we have seen that mentioned a surname identified the interviewee as Donna Bruce, not Donna Page. A group of Newtown parents known as Team Newtown Strong entered the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> and ran the 26 miles to honor the 26 victims of the <kw>sandy hook</kw> shootings, so it\\'s possible Dawn Hochsprung would have been mentioned if one or more of those team members had been interviewed. Man on the Roof Another widely circulated image was snapped by college student Dan Lampariello, who was taking pictures along the race sidelines and coincidentally happened to capture the moment when one of the bombs exploded. The picture he took became a subject of great interest online because it showed a figure striding across the roof of a high-rise building block just as the explosion occurred on the street below, causing many to speculate (without foundation) that the person pictured in the photo had some connection to the <kw>bombings</kw>: No evidence yet suggests there is any reason to connect the person atop a nearby building with either of the <kw>explosions</kw>, as there are plenty of innocuous reasons why someone might have been in that location at the time. Saudi Man Various news accounts reported that 20-year-old Saudi national named Abdul Rahman Ali Al-harbi who was injured in one of the <kw>explosions</kw> was being investigated as a \"person of interest\" by <kw>law enforcement</kw> authorities to ascertain whether he might have had any connection to the <kw>bombings</kw>: <kw>police</kw> took a 20-year-old Saudi national into custody near the scene of the horrific <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> bomb attack, law-enforcement sources said. The potential suspect was questioned by the <kw>fbi</kw> and local <kw>police</kw> at Boston\\'s Brigham and Women’s Hospital, where he was under heavy guard while being treated for shrapnel injuries to his leg sustained in the blast. In late afternoon, a large group of federal and state <kw>law enforcement</kw> agents raided an apartment in a building in the Saudi man’s hometown of Revere, Mass. <kw>fbi</kw> agents could be seen through one window. It was not clear what, if anything, they found. But Revere fire <kw>officials</kw> said they were called out to support bomb-squad officers as part of an investigation of a \"person of interest\" in the <kw>marathon</kw> attack. At the hospital, investigators seized the man\\'s clothes to examine whether they held any evidence that he was behind the attack. The law-enforcement sources also said that the man was not free to leave the medical center. Later news accounts reported that the young man was considered a witness, not a suspect: He didn\\'t do it. The Saudi national questioned in the aftermath of the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> terror blasts that killed three is considered a witness rather than a suspect, sources said. Abdul Rahman Ali <kw>alharbi</kw>, 22, remained hospitalized in <kw>boston</kw> as investigators searched every inch of his Revere, Mass., apartment and grilled his roommate. But it turns out the student was apparently in the wrong place at the wrong time when two bombs exploded near the <kw>finish line</kw> of the event that draws runners from around the <kw>globe</kw>. Alharbi\\'s Facebook page indicated that he was in the United States on a scholarship to study at the New England School of English. He reportedly held a student visa. A school classmate echoed Bada, describing <kw>alharbi</kw> as a low-key guy who never showed any inkling of anti-American sentiment. \"He is a geek,\" said pal Abdullah Alkayid, 19. \"He likes to study a lot. ... He\\'s a quiet person, doesn\\'t like to go out a lot.\" <d>PXD</d> after the <kw>bombings</kw>, a rumor began to circulate that the U.S. would be deporting <kw>alharbi</kw> back to Saudi Arabia <d>2013-04-22</d> on \"security and related grounds.\" Since then contradictory reports have claimed that he is being deported, that he is not being deported, and that the U.S. government was planning to deport him but is <d>PRESENT_REF</d> reconsidering the move (or has decided against it). Suspect Caught on CCTV The \"Help Catch the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> Bomber\" Facebook page posted a picture of a man who was supposedly captured on a CCTV security camera outside a chemical distribution warehouse in the <kw>boston</kw> area: This picture was taken from CCTV surveillance footage outside a chemical distributor storage warehouse (located 15 miles away from the place of explosion — closest chemical warehouse near the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw>). According to the employees who are employed in the warehouse, the man had asked for a chemical <kw>present</kw> in a pentane-air mixture. This type of chemical could be bonded with other chemicals such as the nitric oxide gas, which could cause a massive combustion. Although he was denied the purchase of the chemical (alternative methods of creating explosives are available), there is a high chance that he is responsible or knows something about the <kw>bombings</kw>. If everyone could please like or share this picture and page, we may be able to find out the responsible <kw>people</kw> behind this wicked crime. This picture has absolutely nothing to do with the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon bombings</kw>. It originated with CCTV footage taken back in <d>2011-08</d> and shows one of three men who were observed leaving a building where a burglary took place in Oakham, the county town of Rutland, East Midlands, England. \\'Family Guy\\' Hoax A clip posted on the Internet purported to show a segment from <d>2013-03-17</d> episode of the animated Family Guy television series depicting the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon bombings</kw>: This clip was another hoax accomplished through digital manipulation: One of the more tasteless hoaxes making the rounds in the wake of the <kw>bombing</kw> at the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> revolves around a <d>PAST_REF</d> episode of Fox\\'s Family Guy. \"Turban Cowboy,\" which premiered in the U.S. on <d>2013-03-17</d>, culminates with a scene depicting Peter Griffin accidentally blowing up a bridge by dialing a terrorist\\'s cell phone. But in the <kw>video</kw> making the rounds online, the cell phone scene is placed immediately after an unrelated moment in the episode when Bob Costas, voicing himself, asks Peter how he won the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw>. Aside from the confusion prompted in <kw>people</kw> unaware that the clip is a hoax, it\\'s drawn criticism from those involved with the show. \"The edited Family Guy clip <d>PRESENT_REF</d> circulating is abhorrent. The event was a crime and a tragedy, and my thoughts are with the victims,\" show creator Seth Macfarlane tweeted. Last updated: <d>2015-04-08</d> Allen, Evan and John R.

A jury found that he <kw>helped dias kadyrbayev</kw> dispose of a backpack belonging to <kw>dzhokhar tsarnaev</kw>, which was left behind in the Russian-born bomber’s dorm room.

One of two pressure-cooker bombs goes off as <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> runners make their way to the <kw>finish line</kw> of the race, a Patriots’ Day institution. (Dan Lampariello/Reuters) Matthew Myers, a lawyer for the Kazakh immigrant who studied engineering at the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth, called the verdict “somewhat surprising.” He added the <kw>boston</kw> jury must have felt a “certain pressure” to convict, given the tragedy that befell the city.

       " 11: 'A 29-year-old woman, remembered by her mother for her \"heart of gold.\" A <kw>boston</kw> University graduate student from China who\\'d gone to enjoy the marathon\\'s finish with two classmates. An 8-year-old boy, cheering on runners with his family. Their lives were snuffed out by twin blasts at the tail end of <d>XXXX-XX-XX</d>\\'s <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw>. Thirteen others -- out of 183 hospitalized -- had limbs amputated, according to hospital <kw>officials</kw>. The question is: Why? <d>XXXX-XX-XX</d>, authorities don\\'t have an answer. Unlike after the <d>2001-09-11</d>, <kw>attacks</kw>, no one claimed responsibility for this terrorist attack. No one had been identified as a suspect. The attack came out of nowhere, with no threat. Just horror. As Richard DesLauriers, the special agent in charge of the FBI\\'s <kw>boston</kw> office, put it <d>2001-09-11TAF</d>: \"The range of suspects and motives remains wide open.\" The two identical pressure-cooker bombs -- each with the capacity to hold six liters of liquid, according to a <kw>boston</kw> <kw>law enforcement</kw> source -- blew up seconds and a short distance apart on Boston\\'s <kw>boylston street</kw>. They contained BB-like pellets and nails, the FBI\\'s DesLauriers said, causing even more damage. Photos obtained by <kw>cnn</kw>, which were in a bulletin sent to <kw>federal law enforcement</kw> agencies, showed parts of a pressure cooker, a shredded black backpack and what appear to be metal pellets or ball bearings. Such evidence -- including a partial circuit board -- are headed to an <kw>fbi</kw> facility in Quantico, Virginia, where authorities will try to determine how the devices worked and cull out clues identifying the person or persons responsible. Whatever investigators find, whenever they find it, it won\\'t take away the pain. Scores who are not grieving loved ones are faced with a lengthy physical recovery. There\\'s the psychological battle as well -- living with the memories of the deafening blasts, the carnage, the fear as they searched for loved ones. Ron Brassard was one of them. <d>PT1S</d>, he was laughing and smiling. The next second, there was a roaring blast, originating from about 10 feet away, and he looked down to see a \"puddle of blood.\" He later discovered a \"chunk of the leg was just not there.\" His wife was hospitalized, too, and a friend lost both her legs. Brassard told CNN\\'s Anderson Cooper he is angry. But he\\'s also not about to let this terror change him, any more than it already has. \"You can\\'t let <kw>people</kw> control your life like that,\" Brassard said from his hospital bed. \"You just can\\'t.\" The pressure wave from <d>2001-09-10</d>\\'s <kw>explosions</kw> in Boston\\'s historic <kw>copley square</kw> whipped the once limp international flags straight out, as if they were caught in a hurricane. Some runners said they thought the first blast was a celebratory cannon. By the second, there were no such illusions. Some were spectators, like Carlos Arredondo. An affiliate of the Red Cross, he tended to a man who\\'d lost two of his limbs. Dr. Natalie Stavas, a pediatric resident at <kw>boston</kw> Children\\'s Hospital, was near the home stretch of the race she was running with her father when she heard the blasts. Despite having run 26 miles, she went over barriers and past policemen, until one stopped her. Stavas <kw>told cnn</kw> she told him she was a doctor and pleaded, \"You have to let me help, you have to let me through.\" She said she performed CPR on the first person she encountered. For the next two, she worked to halt their bleeding. Stavas stressed that there were hundreds of others doing whatever they could. While authorities have given no indication they know who was behind the attack, they have offered details on the devices used. DesLauriers, from the <kw>fbi</kw>, said the bombs were possibly placed in pressure cookers hidden inside a backpack or another black nylon bag. Another <kw>law enforcement official</kw> <kw>told cnn</kw> it was \"likely but not certain\" the bombs were on a timer, not set off remotely by a cell phone. Another federal <kw>law enforcement official</kw> said both bombs were small, and initial tests showed no C-4 or other high-grade explosive, suggesting the materials used in the attack were crude. Those killed include 8-year-old Martin Richard, a resident of the city\\'s Dorchester neighborhood whom babysitter Caitlin Doyle recalled as \"just all-around a wonderful kid (with) a big, bright smile that no one could ever forget.\" Lastly, there was the <kw>boston</kw> University graduate student from China -- whom the school and Chinese consulate declined to identify by name. According to a LinkedIn profile, she graduated from a Chinese university with a degree in international economics and was set to earn her master\\'s degree in mathematics and statistics in <d>2014</d> from B.U. Others survived, thanks largely to the work of emergency personnel and volunteers on-site and scores of professionals in several world-class hospitals nearby. Doctors removed more than a dozen nails from one patient, and three had been struck with metal beads slightly larger than BBs, said Dr. Ron Walls, the emergency medicine chairman at Brigham and Women\\'s Hospital. Back in <kw>copley square</kw>, in the heart of <kw>boston</kw>, investigators on <d>2001-09-04</d> continued searching for any hint that might lead them to the perpetrator. Authorities also pleaded for the public\\'s help. Did they know of anyone who made a threat involving <d>2001-04-15</d> or the <kw>marathon</kw>? Did they hear <kw>explosions</kw> in a remote area, possibly as a test run? And did they spot anyone near the <kw>finish line</kw> dropping off what ended up being the two bombs? By <d>2001-04-10T17:00</d>, the <kw>fbi</kw> had gotten more than 2,000 tips, DesLauriers said. They\\'d also begun poring over scores of photos and videos from the scene. At one point, 11 Boston-area hospitals had 23 <kw>people</kw> in critical condition and 40 listed as serious. There are still some fighting, with more surgeries planned. But there is progress. In fact, according to a <kw>cnn</kw> tally, at least 100 of the 183 <kw>people</kw> who received treatment were able to go home by <d>2001-04-10TNI</d>. As has happened before after such terror <kw>attacks</kw>, <d>2001-04-10</d> saw authorities responding to alerts and threats -- in places like Dallas, Cleveland and New York -- that all proved to be unfounded. Security in Los Angeles and New York has been stepped up in light of the <kw>boston</kw> attack, and authorities in London are reviewing measures for that city\\'s upcoming <kw>marathon</kw>. Back in <kw>massachusetts</kw>, one question is what becomes of the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> -- the world\\'s oldest annual <kw>marathon</kw>, dating to <d>1897</d>, drawing more than 20,000 participants. Rather than shutting it down, <kw>officials</kw> promised to build the race back up. That sense of defiance was echoed by Mayor Thomas Menino. Residents and visitors to the city might have to deal with more checks at transit stations and elsewhere. They might have to get used to seeing more authorities out and about. But they shouldn\\'t change their attitudes, said the mayor.',\n",
       " 12: \"On <d>XXXX-04-15</d> of <d>XXXX</d>, a thin kid with a bright smile <kw>named abdulrahman alharbi</kw> decided he would stop and watch the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> for <d>PTXM</d>. A Saudi <kw>arabian studying english</kw> in <kw>boston</kw>, he had heard of the famous <kw>marathon</kw>, but wanted to see it in the flesh, he later explained to one journalist. <d>UNDEF-REF-minute-PLUS-10</d>, he witnessed what he first mistook for fireworks. Then a second blast rocketed him into the middle of the road. “I realized that my legs were a little bit hurt because my jeans were [bloody],” he told the Islamic <d>XXXX-XX</d>. “I was bleeding a little bit in my legs, but all my back was all [bloody] not because of my body but because of other peoples’ body.” <kw>alharbi</kw>, like numerous others in the chaotic few hours following the deadly <kw>bombings</kw>, was questioned by <kw>police</kw>. They asked for his Facebook password. He gave it to them. They asked to inspect his apartment. He allowed it. News of <kw>alharbi</kw> reached the media, but by <d>XXXX-XX-XX</d>, the cops had cleared the 20-year-old. “He has been checked out,” a <kw>law enforcement official</kw> told the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>globe</kw>. “He is not involved. He is just a victim.” Broadcaster Glenn <kw>beck</kw>, formerly of Fox News, was nonetheless suspicious of <kw>alharbi</kw>. He thought the Obama administration was hiding Alharbi’s involvement. So <d>XXXX-XX-XX</d>, <kw>beck</kw> urged the government to release its information on <kw>alharbi</kw> or else <kw>beck</kw> would “expose” him. “While the media continues to look at what the causes were [behind] these two guys, there are, at this hour, three <kw>people</kw> involved,” <kw>beck</kw> said, alleging the U.S. government had “tagged” <kw>alharbi</kw> as a “proven terrorist.” Over several broadcasts, <kw>beck</kw> called <kw>alharbi</kw> the “money man” behind the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>bombings</kw>. “You know who the Saudi is?” <kw>beck</kw> asked. “He’s the money man. He’s the guy who paid for it.” What <kw>beck</kw> said about <kw>alharbi</kw> was untrue. <kw>alharbi</kw> sued <kw>beck</kw> for defamation in federal court in <d>XXXX-03</d>. And <d>PRESENT_REF</d>, in a batch of little-noticed motions, <kw>beck</kw> has lashed back, saying <kw>alharbi</kw> is trying to “punish” and impede Beck’s First Amendment rights. <kw>beck</kw> argues the <kw>bombings</kw> made <kw>alharbi</kw> a “limited purpose” and “involuntary” public figure who must prove not just that <kw>beck</kw> made false accusations, but that <kw>beck</kw> did it with “actual malice.” It’s no surprise that his lawyers would make that argument. Under that standard, whether or not Beck’s claims were false becomes almost irrelevant. In most cases involving public figures, malice is so hard to demonstrate that the matter rarely goes to trial. First, however, Beck’s lawyers will have to convince a judge that <kw>alharbi</kw> is indeed a public figure, albeit an involuntary one, someone who thrusts himself into the limelight. What makes <kw>alharbi</kw> a public figure, according to <kw>beck</kw>? “By behaving suspiciously at the <kw>marathon</kw> finishing line when the bombs detonated, thereby causing his detention and a background check by law enforcement,” states Beck’s motion to dismiss, <kw>alharbi</kw> “embarked on a course of conduct that was reasonably likely to result in public attention and comment on his background, activities, and immigration status.” Plus, he gave interviews defending himself, said Beck’s legal team, led by Michael J. Grygiel. Alharbi’s lawyers, led by Peter J. Haley, were incredulous at Beck’s argument. “An individual does not become a public figure due to the fact that he is investigated in connection with a crime, and then states publicly that he was not involved in the crime for which he was investigated.” To the extent <kw>alharbi</kw> became known to the public, it was because of Beck’s “defamatory reporting.” They accused <kw>beck</kw> of “bootstrapping,” creating his own defense by making a public figure out of <kw>alharbi</kw>. In any case, the student denies he behaved suspiciously — though it’s unclear what would qualify as such a designation. “I [was] really scared because I heard the first bomb, then the second bomb hurt me, then, I was really scared because there might be another one,” he told Islamic <d>XXXX-XX</d>. “Then, I just was walking and the <kw>people</kw> were crying, ‘What happened, what happened?’ … No one arrested me, no one tackled me, no.” He explained to the publication that some emergency personnel looked at him strangely because of “the color of my skin” and “because of the name of my country.” “They were really scared of me,” he recalled. “I am injured, and I don’t have anything and they asked me, ‘What you have in your hand!’ I told them, ‘Nothing, it’s just a napkin!’ And then I throw it to them and they were like, ‘Ahh!'” A court hearing is expected in <d>PXW</d>, according to court filings.\",\n",

At the same time, resources were directed to ensure the safety of our community. As soon as those important tasks were completed, first responders focused on establishing a criminal investigation.

Many of them were already there as part of the general security for the <kw>marathon</kw> already in place.

There, specialized examiners will reconstruct the device and determine its makeup and components. Among items partially recovered are pieces of black nylon—which could be from a backpack—and what appear to be fragments of BBs and nails possibly contained in a pressure cooker device.

The stark pictures of mayhem and the injured sent over TV and the Internet also rekindled stark memories from the 9/11 terrorist <kw>attacks</kw> on New York\\'s <kw>world trade center</kw> and the Pentagon. <d>XXXX-XX-XX</d>\\'s <kw>attacks</kw> also come just <d>P4D</d> before the anniversary of the <d>1995-04-19</d>, bomb attack on Oklahoma City\\'s Murrah Federal Building. The <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> blasts occurred <d>PT12S</d> and 100 yards apart at <d>1995-04-19T14:50</d>, <d>PT3H</d> after Ethiopia\\'s Lelisa Desisa won the 26.2-mile race. <kw>police</kw> searched widely for other explosive devices, and two <kw>law enforcement</kw> <kw>officials</kw> said no other explosive devices had been found. The <kw>officials</kw> said that as many as seven <kw>suspicious packages</kw> were destroyed in controlled <kw>explosions</kw> but they were later found not to be actual bombs. The <kw>law enforcement</kw> <kw>officials</kw> who have been briefed on the matter were not authorized to comment publicly. Authorities also issued a bulletin for an unidentified man who was seen running from a restricted area. It was unclear, according to the federal official, whether the person was anything other than a witness. The state, local and federal investigation into the <kw>bombings</kw> is being led by the <kw>fbi</kw>. Special Agent Rick Deslauriers said investigators were looking at possible terrorism, but he refused comment on specific suspects or leads in the case. \"It is a very active, fluid investigation at this time,\\'\\' he said. Speaking from the White House, a somber President Obama said <kw>people</kw> should not speculate over who was responsible. \"We still don\\'t know who did this or why. <kw>people</kw> should not jump to conclusions before we have all the facts. But make no mistake. We will get to the bottom of this. We will find out who did this. We will find out why they did this. Any individual or responsible groups will feel the full weight of justice.\" The devices were described by the official as relatively small and possibly containing small ball bearings or BB gun pellets designed to serve as shrapnel. It was unclear whether the devices were remotely detonated or included timers, the official said, adding that no conclusions had been drawn on whether an organized group or lone wolf had been responsible for the attack. Multiple media reports indicated a person of interest was being held at an undisclosed hospital. But authorities later dismissed those reports. <kw>davis</kw> said investigators are talking to several <kw>people</kw> but \"there is no suspect at this time.\" A third incident at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library was initially described as a third explosion, but <kw>davis</kw> said <d>1995-04-17TNI</d> that it may have been only a fire. No injuries were reported, but nearby universities were being evacuated. \"After this incident occurred, there were a lot of <kw>people</kw> running from the scene, a lot of them deposited bags and parcels,\" <kw>davis</kw> said. \"Each one is being treated as a suspicious device. At this point, we haven\\'t found any more devices.\" Bloodied spectators were carried to a medical tent intended for runners. At least one <kw>police</kw> officer was hurt. Organizers stopped the race and locked down the <kw>marathon</kw> headquarters. The Federal Aviation Administration announced a temporary flight restriction over <kw>boston</kw>. Cellphone service was operating, wireless companies reported, contrary to an earlier Associated Press report quoting a <kw>law enforcement official</kw> who said service was cut in case there were other undetected devices. The elite women runners started the race at <d>1995-04-17T09:30</d>, and the elite men followed <d>UNDEF-REF-minute-PLUS-30</d>. About 27,000 runners were in the field for the <d>1995-09-11</d> race. Nancy Costa, a medical student from Reading, Pa., was running with her friend Jill Edmonds of Salem, N.H., when the <kw>explosions</kw> erupted. \"It was insane here. Everyone was running. I was right next to the explosion. It threw me,\" she said. \"I never sprinted so fast after a <kw>marathon</kw>. \"The first (blast) threw me onto the ground. And everything went silent and then the second went off and I just covered my head and got up and started sprinting. Everyone was screaming and <kw>people</kw> were getting trampled. We finally found an open T (subway train) that just arrived in Wellington (station). We had to walk a few miles to find one open.\" Kimberly DelGuzzi of Pittsburgh was waiting on <kw>boylston street</kw> for her friend to cross the <kw>finish line</kw> when she found herself pressed against a building, ducking for cover from the blasts. \"At first, I thought it was fireworks, but then I saw the smoke go up in the air,\" said DelGuzzi, who was standing between the two <kw>explosions</kw>. \"Then, not even <d>PT1M</d> later, the second one went off.\" She described the scene as \"mass chaos\" and said, \"Oh my God, it was loud.\" \"The <kw>explosions</kw> shook everything,\" she said, her voice still shaking <d>PT40M</d> after the bombs went off. \"I saw runners down in the street. I saw <kw>people</kw> down on the sidewalk.\" DelGuzzi, 41, has run numerous marathons but was not running in <kw>boston</kw>. Her friend reported to her that she was OK. Jim <kw>davis</kw>, one of the marathon\\'s official photographers, told TheDes Moines Register he was about 50 feet from where the first blast ripped through a glass storefront. \"Debris was falling. Fortunately I was far enough away that there weren\\'t any glass shards,\" said <kw>davis</kw>, 65, of Fairfield, Iowa. \"Then <kw>people</kw> started running and screaming and I realized this is not an accident — I should get out of there.\" After the second explosion, about a block away, <kw>davis</kw> returned for his camera gear and saw one man who had lost both his legs and others who were severely cut. \"I\\'m not a war correspondent,\" he said. \"I\\'m not used to seeing <kw>people</kw> blown up with injuries.\" Tom Beusse, president of the USA TODAY Sports Media Group, had just finished the race and was about 150 yards away from the explosion. \"There was this giant explosion. All of us turned around, the runners, and had these looks on their faces like \\'Oh my God.\\' ... Immediately, it turned into mayhem. <kw>people</kw> were screaming. Cops told us to keep moving away from the <kw>finish line</kw> in the direction we were going. No one knew what was coming next — and thankfully, nothing was next.\" <kw>massachusetts</kw> General Hospital was treating 19 victims, spokeswoman Susan McGreevey said. Six were in surgery in critical condition, four suffering \"traumatic amputations\" from having legs cut off by the force of the <kw>explosions</kw>. Tufts Medical Center had nine patients \"and we\\'re expecting more,\" said spokeswoman Julie Jette. Brigham and Women\\'s Hospital reported receiving 18 to 20 injured from the <kw>explosions</kw>, two in critical condition. As night fell at Brigham and Women\\'s Hospital, a Level 1 trauma center, three <kw>police</kw> officers with rifles stood guard at the front entrance. Inside, physicians cared for 28 victims of the <kw>boylston street</kw> blast, including two in critical condition, two at risk of losing limbs and nine who needed surgery. Staff throughout the hospital felt the impact of the day\\'s events. Social worker Laura Taylor was among those not allowed to leave at <d>1995-09-11T16:00</d> due to a lockdown to ensure security, but instead stayed past <d>1995-09-11T19:00</d> As she checked on patients, other social workers and psychologists tended to family members in expanded waiting areas. \"We\\'ve had other emergencies over <d>P7Y</d> I\\'ve worked here, but nothing where we had to go into lockdown,\" Taylor said. \"This had a level of intensity greater than anything else, just knowing what was happening outside.\" Others gathered outside to comfort one another. Marathoner Kirsten Scott was still wearing her number as she talked with a friend and thought about her husband, a surgery resident tending to patients. \"We\\'re just praying,\" she said. The most common injuries were to bones and tissues. Among the youngest, a 3-year-old was transferred to <kw>boston</kw> Children\\'s Hospital for treatment. Michael Malcolm, a concierge at the Bryant Back Bay apartment building who was a couple of blocks from the race <kw>finish line</kw>, heard the blasts, but said they didn\\'t register until he saw crowds of runners coming up the street, some knocking on the front door of the building asking if they could use his telephone or plug in their cellphones to let loved ones know they were safe. At one point, a perpetual wail of sirens was so loud that <kw>people</kw> had to shout when talking to one another, he said. \"It\\'s scary because we\\'re not used to things happening like this in this city,\" said Malcolm, 21. <kw>police</kw> evacuated a 15-block area around Boston\\'s <kw>copley square</kw> and bolstered security around the city. Security was also increased around Washington and New York. The New York <kw>police</kw> Department has stepped up security around landmarks in Manhattan, including near prominent <kw>hotels</kw>, said Paul Browne, deputy commissioner of the NYPD. \"New Yorkers should be alert. And we ask them to be aware of their surroundings and if they see anything suspicious, call our resources, call 911,\" New York City <kw>police</kw> Commissioner Raymond Kelly said. \"We\\'ve had the experience here of significant events and plots against us, so we would hope that New Yorkers are vigilant,\" said Kelly, referring to the 9/11 terrorist attack, the <d>1993</d> <kw>world trade center</kw> <kw>bombing</kw> and other major incidents. \"We are in the cross hairs of terrorists, and we don\\'t believe the threat has diminished very much. We don\\'t know the genesis of this. We don\\'t know who\\'s responsible for it. But we sort of have to have a 360-degree perimeter in this city and other cities as well, obviously.\"',\n",

Federal prosecutors played the surveillance footage <d>2014-07-14</d> in an attempt to show the close friendship between <kw>tsarnaev</kw> and <kw>azamat tazhayakov</kw>, who is accused of obstructing justice by conspiring to destroy property belonging to <kw>tsarnaev</kw>, including the alleged bomber\\'s laptop and a backpack containing fireworks. If convicted, <kw>tazhayakov</kw> faces <d>P20Y</d> in prison. Prosecutors also released a photo showing <kw>tsarnaev</kw>, <kw>tazhayakov</kw> hanging out with friends in Tazhayakov\\'s New Bedford apartment just weeks before the <kw>bombings</kw>. The prosecution\\'s last witness against <kw>tazhayakov</kw> was <kw>fbi</kw> Special Agent John Walker, who testified about Tazhayakov\\'s internet search history after the <kw>fbi</kw> released suspect images of Dzhokhar and <kw>tamerlan tsarnaev</kw> following the <d>2013-04-15</d> <kw>bombing</kw>. <kw>tazhayakov</kw> reportedly looked at numerous stories about the suspects, and at one point even searched his own name on Google. Defense attorney Matthew Myers said his client was only guilty of being friends with the accused bomber, and pointed to another high profile <kw>massachusetts</kw> case to make his point. \"[Former New England Patriots tight end] Aaron Hernandez spent a lot of time with Tom Brady, right? He did, right?\" Myers asked reporters outside of court on <d>2013-04-15</d>. \"Do you think Aaron Hernandez ever had conversations with Tom Brady about what he was potentially doing? I\\'m not making an evaluation of his case <d>PRESENT_REF</d>.\" The prosecution and defense both rested <d>2013-04-15</d>, with Myers not calling any witnesses for the defense, even though Tazhayakov\\'s father says his son wanted to testify. \"We didn\\'t feel like we wanted to start switching the burden of proof. We know when we start putting witnesses on the jury starts focusing on our case. They should be focused on the prosecutor\\'s case, not ours,\" Myers said. The defense has called the credibility of <kw>law enforcement</kw> <kw>officials</kw> into question, with Myers claiming that they have repeatedly contradicted themselves on the stand. Tazhayakov\\'s father, Amir Ismagulov, says he\\'s hopeful jurors will do the right thing. \"I believe in the <kw>people</kw> of <kw>boston</kw> and I trust them and I just want to hope that they will make their decision based not on emotions but on common sense and the facts that were proven,\" he said through a translator outside court <d>2013-04-15</d>.

       " 24: '<kw>azamat tazhayakov</kw> in an undated photo. CBS <kw>boston</kw> <kw>boston</kw> - A college friend of <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> <kw>bombing</kw> suspect <kw>dzhokhar tsarnaev</kw> has been convicted of impeding the investigation into the <kw>bombing</kw>. <kw>azamat tazhayakov</kw> was charged with obstruction of justice and conspiracy, with prosecutors saying he agreed with a friend\\'s <kw>plan</kw> to remove Tsarnaev\\'s backpack containing altered fireworks from his dorm room <d>PXD</d> after the <d>2013</d> <kw>bombing</kw>. His trial was the first stemming from the <kw>bombing</kw>, which killed three and injured more than 260 near the marathon\\'s <kw>finish line</kw>. <kw>tazhayakov</kw> put his hands over his face and shook his head as the jury announced the verdicts, which it reached on the third day of deliberations. His mother sobbed loudly and rocked in her seat. <kw>tazhayakov</kw> faces a maximum <d>P20Y</d> prison sentence for obstruction and a <d>P5Y</d> maximum for conspiracy but likely will get a lot less under sentencing guidelines. Sentencing was scheduled for <d>2013-10-16</d>. Tazhayakov\\'s lawyers argued that it was the other friend, Dias <kw>kadyrbayev</kw>, who removed the items from the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth dorm room and then threw them away. Prosecutors told the jury that both men shared in the decision to remove the items and get rid of them to protect <kw>tsarnaev</kw>. <kw>kadyrbayev</kw> faces a separate trial in <d>2013-09</d>. A third friend, Robel Phillipos, is charged with lying to investigators. During Tazhayakov\\'s trial, <kw>fbi</kw> agents testified that <kw>tazhayakov</kw> told them he and <kw>kadyrbayev</kw> decided to take the backpack, fireworks and Tsarnaev\\'s laptop computer hours after <kw>kadyrbayev</kw> received a text message from <kw>tsarnaev</kw> that said he could go to his dorm room and \"take what\\'s there.\" The items were removed hours after the <kw>fbi</kw> released photos and <kw>video</kw> of <kw>tsarnaev</kw> and his brother, Tamerlan, and identified them as suspects in the <kw>bombing</kw>. But Tazhayakov\\'s lawyer, Matthew Myers, said his client was a naive college kid who was prosecuted because he was a \"friend of the bomber.\" Myers said <kw>tazhayakov</kw> and another friend, Robel Phillipos, sat passively watching a movie in Tsarnaev\\'s dorm room as <kw>kadyrbayev</kw> took the backpack. Prosecutors acknowledged that <kw>kadyrbayev</kw> is the one who actually threw away the items taken from Tsarnaev\\'s room, but they said <kw>tazhayakov</kw> agreed with the <kw>plan</kw>. The backpack and fireworks were later recovered in a New Bedford landfill. Prosecutors said the fireworks had been emptied of their explosive powder - an ingredient that can be used to make bombs. <kw>tamerlan tsarnaev</kw> was killed in a shootout with <kw>police</kw>. <kw>dzhokhar tsarnaev</kw> escaped, but was found later that day, wounded and hiding in a boat parked in a backyard in nearby Watertown. <kw>dzhokhar tsarnaev</kw> has pleaded not guilty in the <kw>bombing</kw> and is scheduled to stand trial in <d>2013-11</d>.

But mobile companies were saying that was never the case, CNN\\'s Doug Gross reports. \"Verizon Wireless has not been asked by any government agency to turn down its wireless service,\" a spokesman for that company <kw>told cnn</kw>. \"Any reports to that effect are inaccurate.\" In other media reports, Sprint similarly denied being asked to shut down service. Online, Bostonians were being encouraged to stay off of their mobile phones except for emergencies and even open up their wireless connections to help take the load off of the cellular data network. \"If you live or run a business in #Boston near bombsite (please) open your wifi for <kw>people</kw> to use,\" tweeted Disaster Tech Lab, an Irish nonprofit dedicated to providing technology to assist in emergency situations. [Update, <d>XXXX-XX-XXT18:47</d> ET] Initial tests indicate that the two bombs were small and possibly crude, with the tests not indicating any high-grade explosive material was used, a federal <kw>law enforcement official</kw> with knowledge of the investigation <kw>told cnn</kw> national security contributor and former homeland security adviser Fran Townsend. The source said the <kw>fbi</kw> considers the incident a terrorist attack, \"but they\\'ve made clear to me they do not know at this time whether those responsible for the attack were a foreign or domestic group,\" Townsend said. A woman comforts another, who appears to have suffered an injury to her hand. [Update, <d>XXXX-XX-XXT18:35</d> ET] U.S. Rep. Bill Keating, D-Massachusetts, said an unexploded device was found at a hotel on <kw>boylston street</kw>, and another unexploded device was found at an undisclosed location. Keating, who is a member of the House Homeland Security committee and has spoken to <kw>law enforcement</kw> sources, tells CNN\\'s Dierdre Walsh that the incidents were a \"sophisticated, coordinated, planned attack.\" Runners who had not finished the race were stopped before the <kw>massachusetts</kw> Avenue overpass on Commonwealth Avenue. [Update, <d>XXXX-XX-XXT18:14</d> ET] More from President Obama, who just wrapped up his brief statement at the White House: \"We still do not know who did this or why ... but make no mistake: We will get to the bottom of (this). We will find out who did this. We will find out why they did this. ... Any responsible groups will feel the full weight of justice.\" Click to watch <kw>video</kw> [Update, <d>XXXX-XX-XXT18:11</d> ET] President Barack Obama is speaking about the <kw>bombings</kw> <d>PRESENT_REF</d>: “The American <kw>people</kw> will say a prayer for <kw>boston</kw> <d>XXXX-XX-XXTNI</d>, and Michelle and I send out deepest thoughts and prayers to the victims,\" Obama said at the White House. [Update, <d>XXXX-XX-XXT17:59</d> ET] John Manis, an eyewitness in his 50s, was about 200 feet away from the <kw>finish line</kw> near the Prudential building when the <kw>bombings</kw> occurred. He felt the blast to the point that it made him and others around him jump in the air, and some others around him fell down on the ground, he said, according to CNN\\'s Eden Pontz. Manis said he heard two blasts <d>PT5S</d> apart. He said there was confusion all around him, and he was hustled into the nearby <kw>mandarin</kw> Hotel. <kw>officials</kw> wouldn’t let them leave the hotel for a bit, and he says all who were there were all frisked by <kw>police</kw>. He said that when he left, he saw broken storefronts and lots of blood. [Update, <d>XXXX-XX-XXT17:51</d> ET] President Barack Obama is expected to deliver a statement at <d>XXXX-XX-XXT18:10</d> ET from the White House.

[Update, <d>XXXX-XX-XXT17:31</d> ET] <kw>boston</kw> <kw>police</kw> <d>PRESENT_REF</d> appear to be backing away from their commissioner\\'s earlier statement that a third incident - at the JFK Library 5 miles from the <kw>finish line</kw> - might have been related to the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>marathon</kw> blasts. On Twitter, <kw>boston</kw> <kw>police</kw> say: \"<kw>update</kw> JFK incident appears to be fire related.\" [Update, <d>XXXX-XX-XXT17:21</d> ET] Precautions are being taken at the White House because of the <kw>boston</kw> <kw>explosions</kw>, CNN’s Jessica Yellin reports.

Two <kw>people</kw> have been killed, according to <kw>boston</kw> <kw>police</kw>. [Update, <d>XXXX-XX-XXT17:09</d> ET] It will take a long time to clear the area, because lots of <kw>people</kw> dropped bags and whatever else they had when the finish-line blasts happened. Authorities have to check all of those bags, and bomb squads \"may be blowing things up <d>PTXH</d>\" out of precaution, <kw>boston</kw> <kw>police</kw> Commissioner Ed <kw>davis</kw> said. In the words of <kw>boston</kw> <kw>globe</kw> political reporter Cynthia Needham, on Twitter: <kw>thousands of runners</kw> still had yet to finish the race when the bombs exploded in a spectator area along <kw>boylston street</kw> near the <kw>finish line</kw>, <kw>cnn</kw> executive producer Matt Frucci at the scene.

    "- <b>InvertedIndex</b>: An inverted index of the entire set of documents, most notably of its relevant keywords and temporal expressions. It follows the following dictionary structure: `{'term' : [DF, TotFreq, {DocID : [FreqInDoc, [OffsetsDoc], {SentenceID :  [FreqInSentence, [OffsetsSentence]]}]}]`, where `DF` is the `Document Frequency`, `TotFreq` is the `total frequency` of the term within the entire corpus of documents, `DocID` is the `ID of the document` (knowing that IDs start on 0), `FreqInDoc` is the frequency of the term in the document,  `[OffsetsDoc]` is a list of the document offsets, that is, a list of the position(s) where the term appears in the document, `SentenceID` is the `ID of the sentence`, `FreqInSentence` is the frequency of the term in the sentence, `OffsetsSentence` is a list of the sentence offsets, that is, a list of the position(s) where the term appears in the sentence. For instance, a term with the following structure `'2010': [1, 4, {1 : [4, [6, 13, 20, 27], {0 :  [2, [6, 13]], 1: [2, [20, 27]] }]}]` means that it has 4 occurrences in 1 document, in particular in the document with ID 1, namely in position 6, 13, 20, and 27, the first two occur in sentence ID 0, and the latter in sentence ID 1."
