Introduction

1.1 Designing software for older users
This thesis looks at the issues involved in designing software that older people can use effectively. This is an atypical thesis with a much broader scope and broader research aims than most PhD theses. In the period in which the thesis was done (1999-2002) there was virtually no extant literature on designing interfaces for older users. It was obvious that there would be a rapid shift to a much older population with a need to engage with computing. Further it was apparent that older people, particularly older people exposed to computer use for the first time, were finding computer use challenging to say the least. However the HCI community did not appear to be involving itself with this problem. On this basis it was decided that my research should take the form of crisis research where the aim was to open up the area over a broad scope rather than to provide exacting support for a single narrowly defined proposition. This implied using a greenfields approach to the issue of how to design user interfaces for older people rather than the more typical approach in PhD theses of deriving a relatively narrow research question from extant literature. The research aim (rather than research question) was to examine relevant issues for those who intend to design effective user interfaces for older people. The intention behind the aim is to provide a research based enquiry that opens up a new field and at the same time makes computer use more accessible for older people.

In another sense the thesis is an extended case study of the process of acquiring the skills and resources to carry out the design of software that older people can use effectively. The thesis examines the aspects of aging that make older people a distinctive group of users and reports on three studies of creating effective designs for older users that were carried out in the course of the research. This is followed by reflection on the research methodology that was developed in the course of these design studies and further reflection on the design approach itself.

Interface design for a distinct group follows the general directions set out in approaches such as User Centered Design and Task Centered Design. One acquires knowledge of what makes the group distinctive. One acquires knowledge of the tasks that need to be

12

supported by the design and the context within which the design will be used. One then involves members of the group in prototyping and testing at various stages through the creation of the design and its implementation. However the details of the approach may need to be adapted if the group being designed for differs markedly from traditional users. This thesis will provide an examination of adaptations of the approach to interface design that assist in successful interface design for older people.

Design for older people certainly involves adapting designs to the limitations that age imposes. However the study suggests that there are considerable subtleties that are overlooked in a design mantra for older people of "big fonts, big targets and simple layout". There are a wide variety of ways in which age may affect older users in their interaction with an application. In addition there are difficulties within designers' likely assumptions about older users. Older users are both likely to be considerably less able than most designers expect while at the same time older users are likely to be able to carry out more computer based tasks than might be expected from a first acquaintance with their difficulties with computer use. The achievement of effectiveness in older people's computer usage depends on effective support from the interface design, but also on effective training.

The term "older users" represents a degree of lazy thinking. The reason for special approaches to design for some of the older population is that they are age affected, the aging process has reduced some of the abilities we assume in younger users. Some older users can be assumed to have few age reduced abilities well into their lives, the design issues described in this thesis are less relevant to these people. Although the thesis generally uses the less precise term "older users" the point that what is really meant is age affected users should be born in mind. The distinction is somewhat blurred however if, as seems likely, most older people have some age related effects even though they can compensate for a number of them in normal circumstances and so appear less affected by age.

One of the keys to designing for a distinctive group lies in acquiring a wide ranging knowledge of the characteristics of the group. The thesis makes a case that the literature on physical and cognitive aging contains a large body of information that is relevant to interface design for older people. Within the literature study the thesis will set out a

13

summation of the implications of aging for those designing interfaces for older people and this is regarded as a useful resource. However the thesis will suggest that there is considerable value in extensive interaction with older people so as to force designers to confront the realities behind written descriptions of age related effects. Recent research by Newell et al. (2006) makes it clear that being told about the issues of aging does not prepare designers to make the paradigm shift needed in designing for older people. In that study Newell and co-workers found that experienced interface designers persistently discounted information they were given about older people's needs and issues. When these designers finally met with and observed older people working with computers they could fairly be described as stunned by the extent to which they would need to adapt their usual design practices to meet the older people's capabilities. Yet all the points that surprised the designers had been conveyed to them previously by people with extensive experience in design for older people. Thus design for older users requires a decided shift from design for users who are more like the designer. Interaction with older people is a way of achieving such a shift but as will be seen working with older people has its own special skills and sensitivities.

1.2 Relevance
Why is a study of interface design for older people relevant? There are two parts to an answer. The first is that with the demographic shift to an older population there are a considerable number of older people in the population and many of these people find computer use difficult. If interface designs that specifically address aspects of aging allow these people to use computers more effectively, then this clearly falls with in the aims of HCI in terms of studying and improving human-computer interaction. However the current older generation are largely people who have had no previous experience with computers and their struggles with computing are intertwined with the issues of learning computer skills as an older person.

The second aspect of relevance is to address the question of whether there is long term relevance for the study, given that future cohorts of older people will bring considerable experience of computing to their interaction with computers in their old age. We will now proceed to look in more detail at each of these concerns.

1.2.1 The demographic shift
It is now a commonplace that there is a higher proportion of older people in the population. This is due to a lowered death rate among the older section of the population and in many (but not all) western countries, reduced fertility among the younger section that is not fully compensated for by immigration rates. What may be less appreciated is that the scale and speed of this demographic shift is unprecedented.

The data presented here is for the United States, U.S. Census Bureau (2004). US data may in fact show a less rapid move to an aging population than Europe or Japan. This is both because of the high level of immigration from south of the US border and the high birth rate of the US Hispanic population. These factors mean that there is more replacement of younger population groups in the US than in Europe or Japan. None the less the trend is stark. The data can be seen in summary in the following figure 1.1. Supporting detail is supplied in Appendix A.

Figure 1.1 Contrast in US population structure from 1950 to 2030. Y axis gives 5 year age bands with 80+ grouped in the top band. X axis gives percentage contribution to the overall population.

In Figure 1.1 the top band represents the 80+ age group, the bands then descend in 5 year age groupings to age 0 to 4 at the bottom. The X axis gives the percentage that each band contributes to the overall population. What is made very obvious in this figure is that there is a very rapid shift occurring from a triangular population structure with a

15

relatively small proportion of the population over 60 (12.1% in 1950), to a population structure that is more nearly rectangular and having a substantial proportion of the population over 60 (a forecast 25% in 2030). In fact a full 30% of the population is predicted to be over 55 years of age in 2030 so the number of people who may benefit from software that includes adaptations to the effects of aging can be expected to be substantial.

This in turn leads to problems with schemes for supporting older people in retirement caused by the increased number of older people combined with the reduced number of working age tax-payers available to support them. This is predicated to mean that there will be a need for older people to stay in some form of employment for longer, both in order to support themselves and because there are going to be fewer younger workers to replace them. In addition having fewer younger workers means that older people are likely to need to find ways of being less reliant on care givers and younger supporters.

1.2.2 The shift in the role of computing
The demographic shift has come at a time of major technological change, one aspect of which is the increased role of computers in work, communication and access to services. Some extent of computer fluency is becoming a requirement for full access to society. Already computer access can be a cheaper and faster way of accessing services such as banking. It is possible that the price and ease differential may increase to the point where not being able to use computer based services may leave people marginalized. It is also likely that if older people will need to have computer skills if they need to maintain themselves in employment within an increasingly computerized workforce.

1.2.3 Aging for a computer experienced population
The argument is sometimes made that this problem only exists for the current cohort of older people who entered old age without prior computer skills, further it is argued even this group is now on-line and so the issue of older people and computing is vanishing. There is limited direct evidence here but what is available is not reassuring. Firstly there is some evidence that after a very high rate of initial uptake, the rate at which older people are taking up computer use has leveled off and is now doing no more than keep up with new recruits to the older population and those older people who cease using computers, leaving around 80% of the older population as non-computer users, the

16

figures are based on reports from the Pew institute, see Fox (2004). Again, examining the data provided in the Pew reports, in most categories of computer use older users remain the most infrequent and least sophisticated users as well as being the slowest group to adopt new trends.

In addition to this, computer use in the next cohort to become old, current 50 � 65 year olds has not been universal. There will be substantial groups of non computer users within this next older generation. Further there is some evidence that those in the 50 � 80 plus group who have learnt computing skills are on average more able than those who remain non-users. From this it could be argued that the problems facing older beginners may in fact be more severe in the next years than for the older people who adopted computing earlier. Again, where older people delay learning computer skills, the continuing effects of aging mean that the act of delay can make skill acquisition harder. On this basis there will remain a significant section of the older population who have the potential to benefit from gaining computer skills (and from software designed for their needs) but who will not find gaining such skills easy, who may indeed find the required learning harder than did those who went before them. The position of such people will not be helped by the assumption that the issue of computing for older people has been solved.

There is another strand to the counter argument, this suggests that the above is merely about timing. At some relatively near point in the future virtually all new recruits to the older population will have extensive computer experience and then surely the issue of special needs for computing for older people will vanish. Again I suggest that what little is known is not reassuring. One should firstly note that the Pew reports do not suggest that any current adult age group is completely computer literate. Findings on retention of expert behavior into old age from studies by Charness (1988) and Salthouse (1990) indicate that while skilled behavior is preserved into old age, particularly if practice in the behavior continues, there is virtually no generalization of the preserved abilities to presumably closely related abilities. Thus people may continue to practice as respected architects into their seventies but when tested on general problems involving spatial perception they do not perform better than the general older population. The implication is that we (the computer literate) will go into old age with a fairly specific set of computer concepts and skills but we will not find it easy to generalize those skills when the nature

17

of computing undergoes a paradigm shift. It is worth noting that changes in the form of computing are a significant economic driver of the industry and that there is no indication that current changes such as the emergence of the web or the shift to portable and eventually ubiquitous computing represent any cessation of change in the industry. If, as we age, we find it increasingly difficult to adapt to changes, it may well be that in old age we will be most comfortable with the computing skills, concepts and tools we learnt in our mid 50s. Where these are no longer available we will perhaps be more similar to today's bewildered older novices than we might like to imagine. In this case the sections of the thesis on older people's issues in learning computer skills can be expected to retain an uncomfortable relevance.

There is also the point that overwhelmingly software and its interfaces come from designs that are produced by younger designers. The reality is that, unless forcibly restrained, designers will tend to design for people somewhat like themselves. This means that as we age we will be likely to meet software that assumes we can read 8 point fonts on colored backgrounds while dealing with fine manipulation and coping with memory demands that do not accommodate our likely reduction in short term memory capacity. Less rhetorically some of the difficulties that face older computer users come from normal aging. Although there may be some technical progress in alleviating some aspects of aging it is perhaps wise to assume that as those currently computer literate age they will be affected by much the same effects of aging as the current older generation in terms of things such as vision, manipulative skills and declines in aspects of cognitive capacity. Where such effects of aging conflict with the assumptions about ability that designers build into their interfaces, the new computer literate old will still face problems in coping with software. From this perspective those parts of the thesis that examine the ways in which software can be designed so as to make allowances for the effects of aging will also retain their relevance.
