# Time-Matters

Time matters is the result of research conducted by Ricardo Campos during his [PhD](http://www.ccc.ipt.pt/~ricardo/ficheiros/PhDThesis_RCampos.pdf) at the [University of Porto](https://www.up.pt/). The algorithm, initially implemented in C#, has now been made available as a Python package by [Jorge Mendes](https://github.com/JMendes1995) under the supervision of [Professor Ricardo Campos](http://www.ccc.ipt.pt/~ricardo/) in the scope of the Final Project of the Computer Science degree of the [Polytechnic Institute of Tomar](http://portal2.ipt.pt/), Portugal.

## What is Time-Matters
Time matters is a python package that aims to score the relevance of temporal expressions found within a text (single document) or a set of texts (multiple documents). 

The first (Time-Matters-SingleDoc) aims to determine the relevance of temporal expressions within a single document. 

The latter (Time-Matters-MultipleDocs), aims to determine the relevance of temporal expressions within multiple documents. 

[[Table of Contents]](#Table-of-Contents)

## Rationale
Our assumption is that the relevance of a candidate date (d<sub>j</sub>) may be determined with regards to the relevant terms (W<sub>j</sub><sup>\*</sup>) that it co-occurs with in a given context (where a context can be a window of _n_ terms in a sentence, the sentence itself, or even a corpus of documents in case we are talking about a collection of multiple documents). That is: the more a given candidate date (d<sub>j</sub>) is correlated with the most relevant keywords (W<sub>j</sub><sup>\*</sup>) of a document (or documents), the more relevant the candidate date is.

## Documentation
Check out our wiki [Documentation](/wiki) for full details about Time-Matters.

## How to Install Time-Matters

``` bash
pip install git+https://github.com/LIAAD/Time-Matters.git
```
#### Install External Dependencies
Time-Matters rests on the extraction of relevant keywords and temporal expressions found in the text.

For the first (that is, the extraction of relevant keywords), we resort to [YAKE!](https://github.com/LIAAD/yake) keyword extractor.

``` bash
pip install git+https://github.com/LIAAD/yake
```


For the latter (that is, the extraction of temporal expressions), we resort to two possibilities:
- rule-based approach
- [heideltime python wrapper](https://github.com/JMendes1995/py_heideltime)

The first, is an internal self-defined rule-based approach which is directly embedded in the code, thus, it doesn't require any additional procedure. However, if your plan is to use Heideltime you need to install the following packages.
``` bash
pip install git+https://github.com/JMendes1995/py_heideltime
```

You should also have [java JDK](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) and [perl](https://www.perl.org/get.html) installed in your machine for heideltime dependencies (note that none of this is needed should your plan is to only use a rule-based approach).

[[Table of Contents]](#Table-of-Contents)

#### External modules used (only for informative purposes):
    - YAKE
    - numpy
    - nltk
    - Pandas
    - regex
    - py_heideltime
    
##### Linux users
    If your user does not have permission executions on python lib folder, you should execute the following command:
    sudo chmod 111 /usr/local/lib/<YOUR PYTHON VERSION>/dist-packages/py_heideltime/HeidelTime/TreeTaggerLinux/bin/*
    
## How to use Time-Matters-SingleDoc
Time-Matters-SingleDoc aims to score temporal expressions found within a single text. Given an identified temporal expression it offers the user two scoring options:

- <b>ByDoc</b>: it retrieves a unique <b>single</b> score for each temporal expression found in the document, regardless it occurs multiple times in different parts of the text, that is, multiple occurrences of a temporal expression in different sentences (e.g., 2019....... 2019), will always return the same score (e.g., 0.92);

- <b>BySentence</b>: to retrieve a <b>multiple</b> (eventually different) score for each occurrence of a temporal expression found in the document, that is, multiple occurrences of a temporal expression in different sentences (e.g., 2019....... 2019), will return multiple (eventually different) scores (e.g., 0.92 for the occurrence of 2019 in sentence 1; and 0.77 for the occurrence of 2019 in sentence 2);

While the first one evaluates the score of a given candidate date in the context of a text, with regards to all the relevant keywords that it co-occurs with (regardless if it's on sentence 1 or 2), that is, both w<sub>1</sub>, as well as w<sub>2</sub> and w<sub>3</sub> will be considered in the computation of the temporal score of d<sub>1</sub> given by the GTE equation, i.e., (Median([IS(d<sub>1</sub>, w<sub>1</sub>); IS(d<sub>1</sub>, w<sub>2</sub>); IS(d<sub>1</sub>, w<sub>3</sub>)])): 
<p align="center">
  <img src="http://www.ccc.ipt.pt/~ricardo/images/coOccurrences1.jpg" width="300">
</p>

The second, evaluates the score of a given candidate date with regards to the sentences where it occurs (thus taking into account only the relevant keywords of each sentence (within the search space defined)). This means that, if 2010 co-occurs with w<sub>1</sub> in sentence 1, only this relevant keyword will be considered to compute the temporal score of 2010 for this particular sentence. Likewise, if 2010 co-occurs with w<sub>2</sub> and with w<sub>3</sub> in sentence 2, only these relevant keywords will be considered to compute the temporal score of 2010 for this particular sentence. This means that we would have a temporal score of 2010 for sentence 1 computed by GTE equation as follows: (Median([IS(d<sub>1</sub>, w<sub>1</sub>)])), and a temporal score of 2010 for sentence 2 computed by GTE equation as follows: (Median([IS(d<sub>1</sub>, w<sub>2</sub>); IS(d<sub>1</sub>, w<sub>3</sub>)]))
<p align="center">

</p>

How to work with each one will be explained next. But before, both the libraries, as well as the text, need to be imported.

```` bash
from Time_Matters_SingleDoc import Time_Matters_SingleDoc

text= "2011 Haiti Earthquake Anniversary. As of 2010 (see 1500 photos here), the following major earthquakes "\
    "have been recorded in Haiti. The first great earthquake mentioned in histories of Haiti occurred in "\
    "1564 in what was still the Spanish colony. It destroyed Concepci√≥n de la Vega. On January 12, 2010, "\
    "a massive earthquake struck the nation of Haiti, causing catastrophic damage inside and around the "\

#### _SD Default Parameters_
<hr>

This configuration assumes "py_heideltime" as default temporal tagger (more about this [here](#Text-Representation) and [here](#Temporal-Expressions)), "ByDoc" as the default score_type(more about this [here](#How-to-use-Time-Matters-SingleDoc)) and the default parameters of time_matters.
```` bash
Time_Matters_SingleDoc(text)
````
The output is a dictionary where the key is the temporal expression (as it was found on the document) and value is the score given by GTE.

While 'py_heideltime' is the default temporal tagger, a 'rule_based' approach can be used instead.
```` bash
Time_Matters_SingleDoc(text, temporal_tagger=['rule_based'])
````

###### Output
The output is a dictionary where the key is the temporal expression (as it was found on the document) and value is the score given by GTE.
``` bash
#py_heideltime results
{'12 January 2011': 1.0,
 '2010': 0.982,
 '1564': 0.798,
 'January 12, 2010': 0.7425,
 '2011': 0.567,
 'the afternoon of February 11, 1975': 0,
 'Yesterday': 0}

#rule_based results
{'1975': 1.0, '2011': 0.9695, '2010': 0.9035, '1564': 0.856, '1500': 0.853}
```

In addition, one can also ask for multiple scores instead of single scores, that is, multiple occurrences of a temporal expression in different sentences (e.g., "As of 2010..."; "...the quake in 2010 was..."), will return multiple (eventually different) scores (e.g., 0.2 for its occurrence in sentence 1; and 0.982 for its occurrence in the other sentence). 

```` bash
Time_Matters_SingleDoc(text, score_type='BySentence')
````

###### Output
The output here, is a dictionary where the key is the temporal expression (as it was found on the document) and the value is a dictionary (where the key is the sentence ID, and the value is the score of the temporal expression in that particular sentence).
``` bash
#py_heideltime results
{'2011': [(0, 0.831)],
 '2010': [(1, 0.2), (5, 0.982)],
 '1564': [(2, 0.827)],
 'January 12, 2010': [(4, 0.68)],
 '12 January 2011': [(5, 1.0)],
 'the afternoon of February 11, 1975': [(6, 0)],
 'Yesterday': [(7, 0)]}
 ```

#### _SD All the Parameters_
<hr>

Besides the *temporal_tagger* and the *score_type* we can also specify the time matters parameters, which consists of a list of four elements:
- *num_of_keywords*: number of YAKE! keywords to extract from the text. Default value is *10* (but any value > 0 is considered) meaning that the system will extract 10 relevant keywords from the text. More about this [here](#Text-Representation) and [here](#Relevant-Keywords). 
- *n_contextual_window*: defines the n-contextual window distance. Default value is "*full_sentence*" (but a n-window where n > 0 can be considered as alternative), that is, the system will look for co-occurrences between terms that occur within the search space of a sentence; More about this [here](#Computing-Dice).
- *N*: size of the context vector for X and Y at InfoSimba. Default value is '*max*' (but any value > 0 is considered) meaning that the context vector should have the maximum number of n-terms co-occurring with X (likewise with Y). More about this [here](#Context-Vectors).
- *TH*: minimum threshold value from which terms are eligible to the context vector X and Y at InfoSimba. Default value is *0.05* (but any value > 0 is considered) meaning that any terms co-occuring between them with a DICE similarity value > 0.05 are eligible for the n-size vector. More about this [here](#Context-Vectors).

In addition, one can also specify additional parameters for the temporal_tagger. This is particularly evident when the temporal_tagger is py_heideltime, for which we can specify the 'language', the 'date_granularity', the 'document_type' and the 'document_creation_time'. More about py_heideltime parameters [here](https://github.com/JMendes1995/py_heideltime/#How-to-use-py_heideltime).

``` bash
Time_Matters_SingleDoc(text, temporal_tagger=['py_heideltime', 'English', 'full', 'news', '2019-06-01'], time_matters=[10, 'full_sentence', 'max', 0.05], score_type='ByDoc')
```
Obviously, we can also specify a `BySentence` for the score_type as seen before:
``` bash
Time_Matters_SingleDoc(text, temporal_tagger=['py_heideltime', 'English', 'full', 'news', '2019-06-01'], time_matters=[10, 'full_sentence', 'max', 0.05], score_type='BySentence')
```

###### Output
The output is the same as above (as the parameters specified here are exactly the same as the default above ones).

#### _SD Debug_
We also offer the user a debug mode where users can access a more detailed version of the results, namely access to the `Text`, `TextNormalized`, `Score`, `CandidateDates`, `NormalizedCandidateDates`, `RelevantKWs`, `IIndex`, `Dice_Matrix`.

- <b>Text</b>: a slightly normalized version of the input text, where temporal expressions with more than one token are joined with an underscore. By doing this, we guarantee that temporal expressions are easily identified in the text by means of its offset. This may be used for example to highlight or underline a given temporal expression in the context of some GUI.
- <b>TextNormalized</b>: a normalized version of the input text, where temporal expressions appear normalized (according to the temporal tagger used). For instance, the temporal expression `the afternoon of February 11, 1975` will appear as `1975-02-11taf` in the text. This may be used in the DICE_Matrix (more on this bellow) to understand where normalized temporal expressions do appear in the text.
- <b>Score</b>: the output of the score in debug mode depends whether we are using 'ByDoc' or 'BySentence' score. For <b>ByDoc</b> score, the output will be a dictionary, where the key is the temporal expression (as it was found in the text), and the value is a list with two positions (the first is the score determined by Time-Matters; the second is a list of offsets where the temporal expression can be found in the text. Recall that indexes in Python start in 0). For instance, `{'2010': [0.982, [6, 87, 96]]}` means that the temporal expression `2010` has a score of `0.982` and appears at position `6`, `87` and `96`. Similarly, `'the_afternoon_of_February_11,_1975': [0, [103]]` means that the temporal expression `the_afternoon_of_February_11,_1975` has a zero score and appears at position `103`. For <b>BySentence</b> score, the output will be a dictionary, where the key is the temporal expression (as it was found in the text), and the value is another dictionary where the key is the sentence id, and the value is a list with two positions (the first is the score determined by Time-Matters; the second is a list of offsets where the temporal expression can be found in that particular sentence). For instance, `{'2010': {'1': [0.2, [6]]}, {'5': [0.982, [87, 96]]}}` means that the temporal expression `2010` has a score of `0.2` in sentence id `1` where appears at position `6`, and a score of `0.982` in sentence id `5` where appears at position `87` e `96`.
- <b>CandidateDates</b>: a dictionary of the candidates dates (as they appear on the text) and their corresponding normalized version. For instance, the two following hyphotetical entries: `'January_12,_2010': '2010-01-12',`; `'2010-01-12': '2010-01-12'`, means that the two temporal expressions `January_12,_2010` and `2010-01-12` are both normalized to `2010-01-12`. In our algorithm, candidate dates are detected by a `rule_based` solution or by using [py_heideltime](https://github.com/JMendes1995/py_heideltime). If you want to know more about the role of each one in Time-Matters, please refer to the following [link](#Text-Representation).
- <b>NormalizedCandidateDates</b>: a dictionary of the normalized version of the candidates dates and their corresponding instances (as they appear on the text). For instance, the hyphotetical entry : `'2010-01-12' : ['January_12,_2010', '2010-01-12']`, means that the normalized temporal expression `2010-01-12` has at least one entry in the text as `January_12,_2010` and another one as `2010-01-12`. In our algorithm, candidate dates are detected by a `rule_based` solution or by using [py_heideltime](https://github.com/JMendes1995/py_heideltime). If you want to know more about the role of each one in Time-Matters, please refer to the following [link](#Text-Representation).
- <b>RelevantKWs</b>: a list of the relevant keywords used by our algorithm in the process of assigning a score to temporal expressions. In our algorithm, keywords are detected by [YAKE!](https://github.com/LIAAD/yake). If you want to know more about the role of YAKE! in Time-Matters, please refer to the following [link]((#Text-Representation).
- <b>IIndex</b>: An inverted index of the document, most notably of its relevant keywords and candidate dates. As other inverted indexes it follows the following dictionary structure: `{'term' : [SF, TotFreq, {SentenceID : [Offsets]}]`, where `SF` is the `Sentence Frequency`, `TotFreq` is the `total frequency` of the term, `SentenceID` is the `ID of the sentence` (knowing that IDs start on 0), and `[Offsets]` is a list of offsets, that is, a list of the position(s) where the term appears in the text. For instance, a term with the following structure `'2010': [2, 3, {1: [1, [6]], 5: [2, [87, 96]]}]` means that it has 3 occurrences in 2 different sentences. In the sentence with ID 1, it occurs 1 time in position 6. In sentence with ID 5, it occurs 2 times in position 87 and 96.
- <b>Dice_Matrix</b>: It retrieves the DICE matrix (in pandas format) between each term according to the n-contextual window distance defined. For instance, a DICE similarity of 1 between `prime` and `minister` means that, whenever each of these terms occur, they always occur together. If you want to know more about the role of DICE in our algorithm please refer to this [link](#Computing-Dice).
- <b>ExecutionTime</b>: It retrieves information about runtimes, in particular, of the `TotalTime` consumed to execute the algorithm, but also of each of its most important components, namely: `py_heideltime`, `YAKE`, `InvertedIndex`, `DICE_Matrix` and `GTE`.
