# Time-Matters

Time matters is the result of research conducted by Ricardo Campos during his [PhD](http://www.ccc.ipt.pt/~ricardo/ficheiros/PhDThesis_RCampos.pdf) at the [University of Porto](https://www.up.pt/). The algorithm, initially implemented in C#, has now been made available as a Python package by [Jorge Mendes](https://github.com/JMendes1995) under the supervision of [Professor Ricardo Campos](http://www.ccc.ipt.pt/~ricardo/) in the scope of the Final Project of the Computer Science degree of the [Polytechnic Institute of Tomar](http://portal2.ipt.pt/), Portugal.

## What is Time-Matters
Time matters is a python package that aims to score the relevance of temporal expressions found within a text (single document) or a set of texts (multiple documents). 

The first (Time-Matters-SingleDoc) aims to determine the relevance of temporal expressions within a single document. 

The latter (Time-Matters-MultipleDocs), aims to determine the relevance of temporal expressions within multiple documents. 

[[Table of Contents]](#Table-of-Contents)

## Rationale
Our assumption is that the relevance of a candidate date (d<sub>j</sub>) may be determined with regards to the relevant terms (W<sub>j</sub><sup>\*</sup>) that it co-occurs with in a given context (where a context can be a window of _n_ terms in a sentence, the sentence itself, or even a corpus of documents in case we are talking about a collection of multiple documents). That is: the more a given candidate date (d<sub>j</sub>) is correlated with the most relevant keywords (W<sub>j</sub><sup>\*</sup>) of a document (or documents), the more relevant the candidate date is.

## Documentation
Check out our wiki [Documentation](../../wiki) for full details about Time-Matters.

## How to Install Time-Matters

``` bash
pip install git+https://github.com/LIAAD/Time-Matters.git
```
#### Install External Dependencies
Time-Matters rests on the extraction of relevant keywords and temporal expressions found in the text.

For the first (that is, the extraction of relevant keywords), we resort to [YAKE!](https://github.com/LIAAD/yake) keyword extractor.

``` bash
pip install git+https://github.com/LIAAD/yake
```


For the latter (that is, the extraction of temporal expressions), we resort to two possibilities:
- rule-based approach
- [heideltime python wrapper](https://github.com/JMendes1995/py_heideltime)

The first, is an internal self-defined rule-based approach which is directly embedded in the code, thus, it doesn't require any additional procedure. However, if your plan is to use Heideltime you need to install the following packages.
``` bash
pip install git+https://github.com/JMendes1995/py_heideltime
```

You should also have [java JDK](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) and [perl](https://www.perl.org/get.html) installed in your machine for heideltime dependencies (note that none of this is needed should your plan is to only use a rule-based approach).

[[Table of Contents]](#Table-of-Contents)

#### External modules used (only for informative purposes):
    - YAKE
    - numpy
    - nltk
    - Pandas
    - regex
    - py_heideltime
    
##### Linux users
    If your user does not have permission executions on python lib folder, you should execute the following command:
    sudo chmod 111 /usr/local/lib/<YOUR PYTHON VERSION>/dist-packages/py_heideltime/HeidelTime/TreeTaggerLinux/bin/*
    
## How to use Time-Matters-SingleDoc
Time-Matters-SingleDoc aims to score temporal expressions found within a single text. Given an identified temporal expression it offers the user two scoring options:

- <b>ByDoc</b>: it retrieves a unique <b>single</b> score for each temporal expression found in the document, regardless it occurs multiple times in different parts of the text, that is, multiple occurrences of a temporal expression in different sentences (e.g., 2019....... 2019), will always return the same score (e.g., 0.92);

- <b>BySentence</b>: to retrieve a <b>multiple</b> (eventually different) score for each occurrence of a temporal expression found in the document, that is, multiple occurrences of a temporal expression in different sentences (e.g., 2019....... 2019), will return multiple (eventually different) scores (e.g., 0.92 for the occurrence of 2019 in sentence 1; and 0.77 for the occurrence of 2019 in sentence 2);

While the first one evaluates the score of a given candidate date in the context of a text, with regards to all the relevant keywords that it co-occurs with (regardless if it's on sentence 1 or 2), that is, both w<sub>1</sub>, as well as w<sub>2</sub> and w<sub>3</sub> will be considered in the computation of the temporal score of d<sub>1</sub> given by the GTE equation, i.e., (Median([IS(d<sub>1</sub>, w<sub>1</sub>); IS(d<sub>1</sub>, w<sub>2</sub>); IS(d<sub>1</sub>, w<sub>3</sub>)])): 
<p align="center">
  <img src="http://www.ccc.ipt.pt/~ricardo/images/coOccurrences1.jpg" width="300">
</p>

The second, evaluates the score of a given candidate date with regards to the sentences where it occurs (thus taking into account only the relevant keywords of each sentence (within the search space defined)). This means that, if 2010 co-occurs with w<sub>1</sub> in sentence 1, only this relevant keyword will be considered to compute the temporal score of 2010 for this particular sentence. Likewise, if 2010 co-occurs with w<sub>2</sub> and with w<sub>3</sub> in sentence 2, only these relevant keywords will be considered to compute the temporal score of 2010 for this particular sentence. This means that we would have a temporal score of 2010 for sentence 1 computed by GTE equation as follows: (Median([IS(d<sub>1</sub>, w<sub>1</sub>)])), and a temporal score of 2010 for sentence 2 computed by GTE equation as follows: (Median([IS(d<sub>1</sub>, w<sub>2</sub>); IS(d<sub>1</sub>, w<sub>3</sub>)]))
<p align="center">
  <img src="http://www.ccc.ipt.pt/~ricardo/images/coOccurrences2.jpg" width="300">
</p>

How to work with each one will be explained next. But before, both the libraries, as well as the text, need to be imported.

```` bash
from Time_Matters_SingleDoc import Time_Matters_SingleDoc

text= "2011 Haiti Earthquake Anniversary. As of 2010 (see 1500 photos here), the following major earthquakes "\
    "have been recorded in Haiti. The first great earthquake mentioned in histories of Haiti occurred in "\
    "1564 in what was still the Spanish colony. It destroyed Concepci√≥n de la Vega. On January 12, 2010, "\
    "a massive earthquake struck the nation of Haiti, causing catastrophic damage inside and around the "\
    "capital city of Port-au-Prince. On the first anniversary of the earthquake, 12 January 2011, "\
    "Haitian Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive said the death toll from the quake in 2010 was more "\
    "than 316,000, raising the figures in 2010 from previous estimates. I immediately flashed back to the afternoon "\
    "of February 11, 1975 when, on my car radio, I first heard the news. Yesterday..."
````

#### ByDoc
<hr>

Getting temporal scores by doc is possible through the following code. This configuration assumes "py_heideltime" as default temporal tagger (more about this [[here|Text-Representation#Temporal-Expressions]]), "ByDoc" as the default score_type and the default parameters of time_matters.
```` bash
Score, NormalizedCandidateDates = Time_Matters_SingleDoc(text)
#Score, NormalizedCandidateDates = Time_Matters_SingleDoc(text, score_type="ByDoc")
````

#### Output
The output is:
- <b>Score</b>:  a dictionary where the key is the temporal expression (as it was found in the document) and the value is the score given by GTE;
- <b>NormalizedCandidateDates</b>:  a dictionary where the key is the normalized temporal expression (as it was annotated by the temporal tagger) and the value is a list of the related temporal expressions as they were found in the text. or instance, the hyphotetical entry : `'2010-01-12' : ['January_12,_2010', '2010-01-12']`, means that the normalized temporal expression `2010-01-12` has at least one entry in the text as `January_12,_2010` and another one as `2010-01-12`.

``` bash
#Score
{'12 January 2011': 1.0,
 '2010': 0.982,
 '1564': 0.798,
 'January 12, 2010': 0.7425,
 '2011': 0.567,
 'the afternoon of February 11, 1975': 0,
 'Yesterday': 0}

[[Table of Contents]](#Table-of-Contents)

#### BySentence
<hr>

In addition, one can also ask for multiple scores instead of single scores, that is, multiple occurrences of a temporal expression in different sentences (e.g., "As of 2010..."; "...the quake in 2010 was..."), will return multiple (eventually different) scores (e.g., 0.2 for its occurrence in sentence 1; and 0.982 for its occurrence in the other sentence). 

```` bash
Score, NormalizedCandidateDates = Time_Matters_SingleDoc(text, score_type='BySentence')
````

#### Output
Here the output is:
- <b>Score</b>:  a dictionary where the key is the temporal expression (as it was found in the document) and the value is the score given by GTE;
- <b>NormalizedCandidateDates</b>:  a dictionary where the key is the normalized temporal expression (as it was annotated by the temporal tagger) and the value is a list of the related temporal expressions as they were found in the text. or instance, the hyphotetical entry : `'2010-01-12' : ['January_12,_2010', '2010-01-12']`, means that the normalized temporal expression `2010-01-12` has at least one entry in the text as `January_12,_2010` and another one as `2010-01-12`.

```` bash
#Score results
{'2011': [(0, 0.831)],
 '2010': [(1, 0.2), (5, 0.982)],
 '1564': [(2, 0.827)],
