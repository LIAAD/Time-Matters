# Time-Matters

Time matters is the result of research conducted by Ricardo Campos during his [PhD](http://www.ccc.ipt.pt/~ricardo/ficheiros/PhDThesis_RCampos.pdf) at the [University of Porto](https://www.up.pt/). The algorithm, initially implemented in C#, has now been made available as a Python package by [Jorge Mendes](https://github.com/JMendes1995) under the supervision of [Professor Ricardo Campos](http://www.ccc.ipt.pt/~ricardo/) in the scope of the Final Project of the Computer Science degree of the [Polytechnic Institute of Tomar](http://portal2.ipt.pt/), Portugal.

## What is Time-Matters
Time matters is a python package that aims to score the relevance of temporal expressions found within a text (single document) or a set of texts (multiple documents). 

The first (Time-Matters-SingleDoc) aims to determine the relevance of temporal expressions within a single document. 

The latter (Time-Matters-MultipleDocs), aims to determine the relevance of temporal expressions within multiple documents. 

## Rationale
Our assumption is that the relevance of a candidate date (d<sub>j</sub>) may be determined with regards to the relevant terms (W<sub>j</sub><sup>\*</sup>) that it co-occurs with in a given context (where a context can be a window of _n_ terms in a sentence, the sentence itself, or even a corpus of documents in case we are talking about a collection of multiple documents). That is: the more a given candidate date (d<sub>j</sub>) is correlated with the most relevant keywords (W<sub>j</sub><sup>\*</sup>) of a document (or documents), the more relevant the candidate date is.

## Documentation
Check out our wiki [Documentation](../../wiki) for full details about Time-Matters.

## How to Install Time-Matters

``` bash
pip install git+https://github.com/LIAAD/Time-Matters.git
```
#### Install External Dependencies
Time-Matters rests on the extraction of relevant keywords and temporal expressions found in the text.

For the first (that is, the extraction of relevant keywords), we resort to [YAKE!](https://github.com/LIAAD/yake) keyword extractor.

``` bash
pip install git+https://github.com/LIAAD/yake
```

For the latter (that is, the extraction of temporal expressions), we resort to two possibilities:
- rule-based approach
- [heideltime python wrapper](https://github.com/JMendes1995/py_heideltime)

The first, is an internal self-defined rule-based approach which is directly embedded in the code, thus, it doesn't require any additional procedure. However, if your plan is to use Heideltime you need to install the following packages.
``` bash
pip install git+https://github.com/JMendes1995/py_heideltime
```

You should also have [java JDK](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) and [perl](https://www.perl.org/get.html) installed in your machine for heideltime dependencies (note that none of this is needed should your plan is to only use a rule-based approach).

##### Linux users
    If your user does not have permission executions on python lib folder, you should execute the following command:
    sudo chmod 111 /usr/local/lib/<YOUR PYTHON VERSION>/dist-packages/py_heideltime/HeidelTime/TreeTaggerLinux/bin/*
    
## How to use Time-Matters-SingleDoc
Time-Matters-SingleDoc aims to score temporal expressions found within a single text. Given an identified temporal expression it offers the user two scoring options:

- <b>ByDoc</b>: it retrieves a unique <b>single</b> score for each temporal expression found in the document, regardless it occurs multiple times in different parts of the text, that is, multiple occurrences of a temporal expression in different sentences (e.g., 2019....... 2019), will always return the same score (e.g., 0.92);

- <b>BySentence</b>: to retrieve a <b>multiple</b> (eventually different) score for each occurrence of a temporal expression found in the document, that is, multiple occurrences of a temporal expression in different sentences (e.g., 2019....... 2019), will return multiple (eventually different) scores (e.g., 0.92 for the occurrence of 2019 in sentence 1; and 0.77 for the occurrence of 2019 in sentence 2);

While the first one evaluates the score of a given candidate date in the context of a text, with regards to all the relevant keywords that it co-occurs with (regardless if it's on sentence 1 or 2), that is, both w<sub>1</sub>, as well as w<sub>2</sub> and w<sub>3</sub> will be considered in the computation of the temporal score of d<sub>1</sub> given by the GTE equation, i.e., (Median([IS(d<sub>1</sub>, w<sub>1</sub>); IS(d<sub>1</sub>, w<sub>2</sub>); IS(d<sub>1</sub>, w<sub>3</sub>)])): 
<p align="center">
  <img src="http://www.ccc.ipt.pt/~ricardo/images/coOccurrences1.jpg" width="300">
</p>

The second, evaluates the score of a given candidate date with regards to the sentences where it occurs (thus taking into account only the relevant keywords of each sentence (within the search space defined)). This means that, if 2010 co-occurs with w<sub>1</sub> in sentence 1, only this relevant keyword will be considered to compute the temporal score of 2010 for this particular sentence. Likewise, if 2010 co-occurs with w<sub>2</sub> and with w<sub>3</sub> in sentence 2, only these relevant keywords will be considered to compute the temporal score of 2010 for this particular sentence. This means that we would have a temporal score of 2010 for sentence 1 computed by GTE equation as follows: (Median([IS(d<sub>1</sub>, w<sub>1</sub>)])), and a temporal score of 2010 for sentence 2 computed by GTE equation as follows: (Median([IS(d<sub>1</sub>, w<sub>2</sub>); IS(d<sub>1</sub>, w<sub>3</sub>)]))
<p align="center">

How to work with each one will be explained next. But before, both the libraries, as well as the text, need to be imported.

```` bash

#### ByDoc
<hr>

Getting temporal scores by doc is possible through the following code. This configuration assumes "py_heideltime" as default temporal tagger (more about this  [[here|Text-Representation#Temporal-Expressions]]), "ByDoc" as the default score_type and the default parameters of time_matters. In this configuration, a single score will be retrieved for a temporal expression regardless it occurs in different sentences.

```` bash
Score, TempExpressions, RelevantKWs, TextNormalized, TextTokens, SentencesNormalized, SentencesTokens = Time_Matters_SingleDoc(text)
#Score, TempExpressions, RelevantKWs, TextNormalized, TextTokens, SentencesNormalized, SentencesTokens = Time_Matters_SingleDoc(text, score_type="ByDoc")
````

#### BySentence
<hr>

Getting temporal scores by sentence is possible through the following code. This configuration assumes "py_heideltime" as default temporal tagger (more about this [[here|Text-Representation#Temporal-Expressions]]), "BySentence" as the score_type and the default parameters of time_matters. In this configuration, multiple occurrences of a temporal expression in different sentences (e.g., "As of 2010..."; "...the quake in 2010 was..."), will return multiple (eventually different) scores (e.g., 0.2 for its occurrence in sentence 1; and 0.982 for its occurrence on the other sentence).

```` bash
Score, NormalizedCandidateDates = Time_Matters_SingleDoc(text, score_type='BySentence')
````

#### Output
In the following, we explain the output obtained by the execution of the previous code (be it ByDoc or BySentence).
The structure of the score depends on the type of extraction considered: `ByDoc` or `BySentence`.

- <b>Score (for ByDoc)</b>:  A dictionary where the key is the normalized temporal expression and the value is a list with two positions. The first is the score of the temporal expression. The second is a list of the instances of the temporal expression (as they were found in the text). Example: `'2011-01-12': [0.5, ['2011-01-12', '12 January 2011']],`, means that the normalized temporal expression `2011-01-12` has a score of 0.5 and occurs twice in the text. The first time as `2011-01-12`, and the second time as `12 January 2011`.

```` bash
{'2011-01-12': [1.0, ['12 January 2011']],
 '2010': [0.983, ['2010', '2010', '2010']],
 '1564': [0.799, ['1564']],
 '2010-01-12': [0.743, ['January 12, 2010']],
 '2011': [0.568, ['2011']],
 '1975-02-11taf': [0, ['the afternoon of February 11, 1975']],
 '1975-02-10': [0, ['Yesterday']]}
````

- <b>Score (for BySentence)</b>:  A dictionary where the key is the normalized temporal expression and the value is a dictionary (where the key is the sentenceID and the value is a list with two positions. The first is the score of the temporal expression in that particular sentence. The second is a list of the instances of the temporal expression (as they were found in the text in that particular sentence). Example: `{'2010': {1: [0.2, ['2010']], 5: [0.983, ['2010', '2010']]}}`, means that the normalized temporal expression `2010` has a score of 0.2 in the sentence with ID 1, and a score of 0.983 in the sentence with ID 5 (where it occurs two times).

```` bash
{'2011': {0: [0.831, ['2011']]},
 '2010': {1: [0.2, ['2010']], 5: [0.983, ['2010', '2010']]},
 '1564': {2: [0.828, ['1564']]},
 '2010-01-12': {4: [0.68, ['January 12, 2010']]},
 '2011-01-12': {5: [1.0, ['12 January 2011']]},
 '1975-02-11taf': {6: [0, ['the afternoon of February 11, 1975']]},
 '1975-02-10': {7: [0, ['Yesterday']]}}

## How to use Time-Matters-MultipleDocs
Time-Matters-MultipleDosc aims to score temporal expressions found within multiple texts. Given an identified temporal expression it offers the user three scoring options:

TODO TODOTODOTODO TODOTODOTODOTODOTODOTODOTODOTODOTODOTODOTODOTODOTODO

- <b>ByDoc</b>: it retrieves a unique <b>single</b> score for each temporal expression found in the document, regardless it occurs multiple times in different parts of the text, that is, multiple occurrences of a temporal expression in different sentences (e.g., 2019....... 2019), will always return the same score (e.g., 0.92);

- <b>BySentence</b>: to retrieve a <b>multiple</b> (eventually different) score for each occurrence of a temporal expression found in the document, that is, multiple occurrences of a temporal expression in different sentences (e.g., 2019....... 2019), will return multiple (eventually different) scores (e.g., 0.92 for the occurrence of 2019 in sentence 1; and 0.77 for the occurrence of 2019 in sentence 2);

While the first one evaluates the score of a given candidate date in the context of a text, with regards to all the relevant keywords that it co-occurs with (regardless if it's on sentence 1 or 2), that is, both w<sub>1</sub>, as well as w<sub>2</sub> and w<sub>3</sub> will be considered in the computation of the temporal score of d<sub>1</sub> given by the GTE equation, i.e., (Median([IS(d<sub>1</sub>, w<sub>1</sub>); IS(d<sub>1</sub>, w<sub>2</sub>); IS(d<sub>1</sub>, w<sub>3</sub>)])): 
<p align="center">
  <img src="http://www.ccc.ipt.pt/~ricardo/images/coOccurrences1.jpg" width="300">
</p>

The second, evaluates the score of a given candidate date with regards to the sentences where it occurs (thus taking into account only the relevant keywords of each sentence (within the search space defined)). This means that, if 2010 co-occurs with w<sub>1</sub> in sentence 1, only this relevant keyword will be considered to compute the temporal score of 2010 for this particular sentence. Likewise, if 2010 co-occurs with w<sub>2</sub> and with w<sub>3</sub> in sentence 2, only these relevant keywords will be considered to compute the temporal score of 2010 for this particular sentence. This means that we would have a temporal score of 2010 for sentence 1 computed by GTE equation as follows: (Median([IS(d<sub>1</sub>, w<sub>1</sub>)])), and a temporal score of 2010 for sentence 2 computed by GTE equation as follows: (Median([IS(d<sub>1</sub>, w<sub>2</sub>); IS(d<sub>1</sub>, w<sub>3</sub>)]))
